Abstract: The increasing availability of online information has necessitated intensive
research in the area of automatic text summarization within the Natural Lan-
guage Processing (NLP) community. Over the past half a century, the prob-
lem has been addressed from many diﬀerent perspectives, in varying domains
and using various paradigms. This survey intends to investigate some of the
most relevant approaches both in the areas of single-document and multiple-
document summarization, giving special emphasis to empirical methods and
extractive techniques. Some promising approaches that concentrate on speciﬁc
details of the summarization problem are also discussed. Special attention is
devoted to automatic evaluation of summarization systems, as future research
on summarization is strongly dependent on progress in this area.
