Abstract: MACAON is a tool suite for standard NLP tasks
developed for French. MACAON has been de-
signed to process both human-produced text
and highly ambiguous word-lattices produced
by NLP tools. MACAON is made of several na-
tive modules for common tasks such as a tok-
enization, a part-of-speech tagging or syntac-
tic parsing, all communicating with each other
through XML ﬁles . In addition, exchange pro-
tocols with external tools are easily deﬁnable.
MACAON is a fast, modular and open tool, dis-
tributed under GNU Public License.
