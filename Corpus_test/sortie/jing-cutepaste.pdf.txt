Abstract 

We present a cut and paste based text summa- 
rizer, which uses operations derived from an anal- 
ysis of human written abstracts. 
The summarizer 

edits extracted sentences, using reduction to remove 
inessential phrases and combination to merge re- 
suiting phrases together as coherent sentences. Our 
work includes a statistically based sentence decom- 
position program that identifies where the phrases of 
a summary originate in the original document, pro- 
ducing an aligned corpus of summaries and articles 
which we used to develop the summarizer.

Introduction 

There is a big gap between the summaries produced 
by current automatic summarizers and the abstracts 
written by human professionals. Certainly one fac- 
tor contributing to this gap is that automatic sys- 
tems can not always correctly identify the important 
topics of an article. Another factor, however, which 
has received little attention, is that automatic sum- 
marizers have poor text generation techniques. Most 
automatic summarizers rely on extracting key sen- 
tences or paragraphs from an article to produce a 
summary. Since the extracted sentences are discon- 
nected in the original article, when they are strung 
together, the resulting summary can be inconcise, 
incoherent, and sometimes even misleading. 

We present a cut and paste based text sum- 

marization technique, aimed at reducing the gap 
between automatically generated summaries and 
human-written abstracts. 
Rather than focusing 

on how to identify key sentences, as do other re- 
searchers, we study how to generate the text of a 
summary once key sentences have been extracted. 

The main idea of cut and paste summarization 

is to reuse the text in an article to generate the 
summary. 
However, instead of simply extracting 

sentences as current summarizers do, the cut and 
paste system will "smooth" the extracted sentences 
by editing them. Such edits mainly involve cutting 
phrases and pasting them together in novel ways. 

The key features of this work are: 
(1) The identification of cutting and past- 

ing operations. We identified six operations that 
can be used alone or together to transform extracted 
sentences into sentences in human-written abstracts. 
The operations were identified based on manual and 
automatic comparison of human-written abstracts 
and the original articles. Examples include sentence 
reduction, sentence combination, syntactic transfor- 
mation, and lexical paraphrasing. 

(2) Development of an automatic system to 

perform cut and paste operations. Two opera- 
tions - sentence reduction and sentence combination 
- are most effective in transforming extracted sen- 
tences into summary sentences that are as concise 
and coherent as in human-written abstracts. 
We 

implemented a sentence reduction module that re- 
moves extraneous phrases from extracted sentences, 
and a sentence combination module that merges the 
extracted sentences or the reduced forms resulting 
from sentence reduction. 
Our sentence reduction 

model determines what to cut based on multiple 
sources of information, including syntactic knowl- 
edge, context, and statistics learned from corpus 
analysis. It improves the conciseness of extracted 
sentences, making them concise and on target. Our 
sentence combination module implements combina- 
tion rules that were identified by observing examples 
written by human professionals. It improves the co- 
herence of extracted sentences. 

(3) Decomposing human-wrltten summary 

sentences. The cut and paste technique we propose 
here is a new computational model which we based 
on analysis of human-written abstracts. To do this 
analysis, we developed an automatic system that can 
match a phrase in a human-written abstract to the 
corresponding phrase in the article, identifying its 
most likely location. This decomposition program 
allows us to analyze the construction of sentences 
in a human-written abstract. Its results have been 
used to train and test the sentence reduction and 
sentence combination module. 

In Section 2, we discuss the cut and paste tech- 

nique in general, from both a professional and com- 
putational perspective. We also describe the six cut 
and paste operations. In Section 3, we describe the
