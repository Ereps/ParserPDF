Title: Cut and Paste Based Text Summarization
Authors: Hongyan  Jing, Kathleen  R. McKeown
Abstract: We present a cut and paste based text summarizer, which uses operations derived from an analysis of human written abstracts.  The summarizerWe present a cut and paste based text summarizer, which uses operations derived from an analysis of human written abstracts.  The summarizeredits extracted sentences, using reduction to remove  inessential phrases and combination to merge resuiting phrases together as coherent sentences. Our  work includes a statistically based sentence decomposition program that identifies where the phrases of  a summary originate in the original document, producing an aligned corpus of summaries and articles  which we used to develop the summarizer.
