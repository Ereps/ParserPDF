The summarizer 
We present a cut and paste based text summa rizer, which uses operations derived from an anal ysis of human written abstracts.  The summarizeredits extracted sentences, using reduction to remove  inessential phrases and combination to merge re suiting phrases together as coherent sentences. Our  work includes a statistically based sentence decom position program that identifies where the phrases of  a summary originate in the original document, pro ducing an aligned corpus of summaries and articles  which we used to develop the summarizer.
