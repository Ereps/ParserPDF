	<abstract>In this article we present the RST Spanish  Treebank, the first corpus annotated with  rhetorical relations for this language. We  describe the characteristics of the corpus,  the annotation criteria, the annotation  procedure, the inter-annotator agreement,  and other related aspects. Moreover, we  show the interface that we have developed  to carry out searches over the corpusâ€™  annotated texts.</abstract>
