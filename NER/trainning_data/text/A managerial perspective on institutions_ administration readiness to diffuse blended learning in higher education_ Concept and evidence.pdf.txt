Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203 A Managerial Perspective on Institutions Administration Readiness to Diffuse Blended Learning in Higher Education: Concept and Evidence Bokolo Anthony Jr. et al. Department of Computer Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology NTNU, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway Abstract There has been rapid development in Blended Learning (BL) diffusion and prior studies mainly  focused on issues related to students and lecturers in improving teaching and learning outcomes,  but very few studies focused on institution’s readiness and diffusion issues. Thus, there is need for  institutional-based research to guide universities, colleges, and polytechnics to strategically diffuse  BL. Accordingly, this study develops a model to investigate the variables and associated factors  that influence institutions administration readiness to diffuse BL initiatives based on Diffusion of  Innovation (DoI) theory and institutional BL adoption framework that comprises of mature  implementation stage of BL. Quantitative research approach was employed and data was collected  using online survey questionnaire from 223 e-learning administrators/managers in Malaysia  universities, colleges, and polytechnics. Next, Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling  (PLS-SEM) technique was employed for data analysis. Results indicate that institutional structure,  resource support, technology infrastructure, management strategies, and ethical considerations are  key variables that positively predict administration readiness to diffuse BL initiatives in higher  education. Additional results from Importance Performance Map Analysis (IPMA) in PLS-SEM  suggest that institutional structure has the strongest effect on administrators’ readiness to diffuse  BL and is also the most important variable that influences BL diffusion in institutions.  Theoretically, findings from this study provide insights on how institutions’ administration  perception and acceptance of BL approach can be enhanced. Practically, the developed model can  be employed as a readiness tool to assess institutions current state in implementing BL  environment and further provides a road map for future improvement.

Introduction Nowadays, Blended Learning (BL) adoption is increasing in higher education across the world and it involves the integration of two distinct paradigms which combines classroom and  online learning activities in an optimal approach to improve student learning outcomes (Kuar,  2013). BL aims to address important institutional issues by integrating offline and online modes  to ensure the efficient utilization of course resources to achieve teaching goal and learning  objectives (Carbonell, Dailey-Hebert, and Gijselaers, 2013). Institutions are now initiating policies  that support BL adoption by increasing their commitment to enhance student learning as well as  create access to learning materials, provide flexible learning modes, and offering cost effectiveness  e-learning platforms (Dakduk, Santalla-Banderali, and van der Woude, 2018; Ghazal, Al-Samarraie,  and Aldowah, 2018). Conversely, despite the benefits provided by BL, many institutions have  failed to successfully adopt BL for teaching and learning due to issues related to increase cost of  technology, poor decisions strategy, inadequate support, and absence of a comprehensible strategy * Corresponding author. E-mail address: anthony.j.bokolo@ntnu.no Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203    (Graham, Woodfield, and Harrison, 2013; Tamim, 2018). Thus, there is need for administration full  involvement if BL adoption is to be successfully diffused in higher education (Moskal, Dziuban,  and Hartman, 2013). Furthermore, it is required for institutions to provide devoted services to support students in learning with BL and lecturers throughout their pedagogical design and use of BL to create  course modules for teaching (Machado, 2007). This comprises allocating resources to support  lecturers and students to become actively involved and fully aware of BL initiatives (Poon, 2014).  Moreover, BL adoption in higher education is effective when the institution administration is  dedicated to improving the quality of student academic experience in a cost-effective approach  (Moskal et al., 2013). Technology mediated learning is then viewed as a medium of attaining  institutions strategic goal (Graham et al., 2013). Although, it is challenging to allocate resources  and align policies to meet strategic goal of re-designing BL courses, as this leads to resistance to  institutional change which was mentioned as one of the major reasons why institutions failed to  restructure their educational policies (Chong, Cheah, and Low, 2010). Similarly, academicians such  as Alshehri (2017) stated that it is inevitable that lecturers and students will implement BL  approaches in a significant way if there are clear policies to direct and guide BL adoption.  Accordingly, institutions aiming to improve their current BL initiatives may consider enhancing  their technical support and infrastructures to address the needs of students and lecturers (Graham,  2013). They may also recruit existing BL experts from other institutions to assist with professional  development (Porter, Graham, Bodily, and Sandberg, 2016). Additionally, Al-Rahmi et al. (2018) argued that institutions are faced with governance issues when they diffuse BL approaches for teaching and learning and these issues includes 84.5  percent inadequate human resource, 11.5 percent less top management support, and 69.2 percent  lack of incentives. Thus, Al-Rahmi et al. (2018) recommended for a robust governance policy to  promote BL planning responsibilities and implementation. Accordingly, for BL approaches to be  seen as part of the institutional academic objectives, the faculties must be ready to translate BL  policy into actual BL implementation for teaching and learning activities (Machado, 2007). Hence,  administration must specify precise roles that BL should play in institutional development agenda  in offering proper direction for planning and operation of BL approaches (Mercado, 2008).  Administration need to outline existing options on how to diffuse BL approaches in teaching, for  example by providing guidance on different dimensions of BL, and more recognized pedagogic  strategies (Basir, Ahmad, and Noor, 2010). Evidently, BL adoption in higher education has become an imperative issue for many institutions (Dziuban and Moskal, 2011; Spring, Graham, and Hadlock, 2016). Likewise, one of the  challenges of higher education is to evaluate the readiness of institutions administration towards  initiating polices that progress BL (Machado, 2007; Mercado, 2008). Although, the success of BL  in institutions may be initiated by lecturers and students’ diffusion, however BL survival is based  on the readiness of administration (Al-Busaidi, 2012). Moreover, there has been rapid growth in  research and development in BL and most studies are mostly focused on improving teaching and Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203    learning effectiveness of students and lecturers (Graham et al., 2013; Porter et al., 2016). Yet, only  fewer studies have explored BL from institutions administrator’s perspective (Porter, Graham,  Spring, and Welch, 2014; Smith and Hill, 2018). Thus, there is need for research focused on  institutional BL policy and diffusion issues to help guide administrators to strategically diffuse BL  in their respective institutions (Graham et al., 2013). Likewise, academicians such as Graham et  al. (2013); Ghazal, Al-Samarraie, and Aldowah (2018) calls for studies that examines the specific  influential variables and related factors that predicts administrations’ readiness to institutionalize  BL. Consequently, more empirical evidence is required to clearly depict how certain technological,  institutional, and individual related variables can contribute to administrators’ readiness in  diffusing BL (Moskal et al., 2013). Similarly, Fesol and Salam (2016) highlighted that there is  need for institutions to develop BL policies that provide comprehensive guideline for initializing  and diffusing BL approaches for academic activities. Furthermore, prior BL studies investigated administrator perception towards BL in individual institutional context, but there are limited studies that examined universities, colleges,  and polytechnics diffusion of BL concurrently (Mercado, 2008; Basir et al., 2010). Hence, there is  need for a study that examines administrators’ readiness from several institutions such as  universities, colleges, and polytechnics. Accordingly, this study addressed the following research  questions: RQ1-Which variables and associated factors influence administrators’ readiness to diffuse BL? RQ2-How to assess e-learning managers and administrators’ readiness to diffuse BL? RQ3What are the importance and impact levels of the identified variables? In response to these research questions, this study develops a model to investigate the variables and related factors that influence institutions administration readiness to diffuse BL  initiatives based on Diffusion of Innovation (DoI) theory and institutional BL adoption framework.  The remainder of the study is structured as follows. Section 2 is the literature review. Section 3 is  the model and hypotheses development and Section 4 describes the research methodology. Section  5 is the results and discussion, Section 6 is the implications of study and Section 7 is the conclusion.  2. Literature Review  2.1. Background of Blended Learning in Malaysia Higher Education Based on the Malaysian Nation Vision 2020 to become a developed nation, the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education (MOE) developed a National Education Blueprint (2013-2025)  (Edward, Asirvatham, and Johar, 2018), which is also part of the Vision 2020 of the country aligned  with cultivating science and technology educational policy as one of the significant drivers for  attaining the Nation Vision 2020 (Siew-Eng and Muuk, 2015). One of the plans of MOE regarding  the Education Blueprint 2013-2025 is the government’s targets of introducing Information Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203    Communication Technology (ICT) innovations to facilitate teaching and learning activities by  acknowledging the prominence of ICT to improve teaching pedagogies and curriculum  development (MOE, 2015). Accordingly, institutions in Malaysia have positively responded to  this plan by implementing in-house e-learning platforms and Face-to-Face (F2F) physical class  room learning (Tan and Neo, 2015). Similarly, universities, colleges, and polytechnics in Malaysia  have begun to facilitate conventional teaching approaches with online learning environments, thus  answering the call by MOE to utilize ICT in teaching and learning for creating innovative and  capable graduates (Tan and Neo, 2015). In a bid to foster diffusion of BL approaches in institution, Malaysia government supports BL initiatives by providing ICT infrastructure to all institutions (Ta'a, Bakar, and Shahbani, 2017),  restructures their current curriculum, and provides seasonal assessments after conducting  workshop and training for academic staffs to improve their skills and knowledge in utilizing ICT  for teaching (Tahar et al., 2013). Respectively, to translate the national education blueprint (20132025) into tangibles outcomes, deployment of technology mediated learning applications such as  Open Distance Learning (ODL) and Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) are being  implemented by institutions in Malaysia to promote non-formal learning and professional  development among students (Isa et al., 2015). Also, these institutions are utilizing other platforms  such as Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment (Moodle) which is a free opensource e-learning system (Lança and Bjerre, 2018). 2.2.Overview of Diffusion of Innovation Theory Diffusion of innovation (DoI) theory was developed by Rogers (2003) to offers in-depth investigation of how new innovations are diffused, and how adoption decisions are affected by  perceptions of end user towards technology as well as the characteristics of the adopting institution  and its environment. Respectively, Rogers (2003) defined diffusion as the progression by which  an innovation is deployed through various channels over time across members of a collective  system (Porter et al., 2016). Rogers categorized innovation adopters into five groups based on  shared values and characteristics which include innovators, early adopters, early majority, late  majority, and laggards (Porter and Graham, 2016). In the context of BL, DoI theory can be  employed to provide guidance as to how BL adoption in institutions can be accelerated.  Figure 1 Blended learning implementation stages Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203  Accordingly, Porter and Graham (2016); Porter et al. (2016) extended Rogers' (2003) diffusion of innovations theory and suggested that the stages of BL adoption in institution comprise  of exploration/awareness, early implementation/adoption, and growth/mature implementation as  seen in Figure 1, which depicts how institutions move their interest in BL to a mature  institutionalization of BL. Each of the stage is discussed below; • Stage 1: exploration/awareness is relates to institutions having no initiatives that promote BL adoption (Graham et al., 2013). In this stage the institutions are aware of the potential of BL  but are faced with limited support to explore mediums that can be employed to diffuse BL  approaches for teaching and learning (Porter et al., 2016). • Stage 2: early implementation/adoption involves the institutions adoption of BL approaches and initiatives based on new policies and strategies to facilitate BL implementation (Graham  et al., 2013; Porter et al., 2014). • Stage 3: growth/mature implementation involve the existence of well-established BL support, structure, and strategies that are essential to facilitate BL implementation (Graham et al., 2013;  Porter et al., 2016). Although, Rogers' (2003) categorized the characteristics of innovation adoption into five categories, this study is more focused on stages of BL adoption similar to prior studies (Graham  et al., 2013; Porter et al., 2014), and not the categories as previous examined by Porter and Graham  (2016); Porter et al. (2016). This is because, this study aims to examine the variables that influence  institutions administrators’ readiness to diffuse BL in providing institutional administrators and  others interested in BL adoption with information regarding how to facilitate BL adoption among  their respective institutions. Furthermore, since Malaysia universities, colleges, and polytechnics  are already adopting BL as discussed in Section 2.1, this study is mainly concerned with examining  stage 3 which is the growth or mature BL implementation in Malaysia universities, colleges, and  polytechnics. 2.3. Background of Institutional Blended Learning Adoption Framework The framework for institutional adoption of BL in higher education was proposed by Graham et al. (2013) based on the growth/mature implementation stage as discussed in Section 2.2  grounded on institutional support, structure, and strategy as the main constructs. Thus, the  proposed institutional BL adoption framework is shown in Figure 2 which comprises of three  constructs as discussed below; • Institutional strategy entails issues relating to complete BL design, such as BL definition, advocacy procedures, degree of implementation, BL purposes, and policies initiated to  institutionalize BL (Porter et al., 2016). In summary the strategy comprises of purpose,  advocacy, and definition (Graham et al., 2013). • Institutional structure comprises issues associated with the pedagogical, technological, administrative governance, scheduling and evaluation procedures that facilitates BL diffusion Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203 (Graham et al., 2013). In summary this construct comprises of infrastructure, scheduling,  governance, evaluation, and professional development (Porter et al., 2016). • Institutional support involves issues that address how institutions implements and maintains its BL approaches, including pedagogical support, technical support, and incentives (Porter et  al., 2014). Thus, this construct includes financial incentives, pedagogical support, technical  support, tenure promotion, and course load reduction (Graham et al., 2013).  Figure 2 Institutional blended learning adoption framework Therefore, this study employs both DoI theory and institutional BL adoption framework to investigate the variables that influences institutions administration readiness to diffuse BL  initiatives. However, there are other variables such as the culture, norms, attitude which are beyond  the scope of this study and are not covered by the integrated frameworks. 2.4.Related Works This sub-section reviews prior studies that proposed approaches that examined BL adoption from the lens of institutions’ administration as reviewed in Table 1. Respectively, Table  1 review prior studies that investigated BL adoption in institutional perspective, however very  limited or no study has investigated administration/management readiness of diffusing BL  approaches empirically based on statistical data. Moreover, only few studies have investigated  institutions administration readiness in Malaysia higher education. Hence, this research would be  one of the few studies that provide empirical evidence of universities, colleges, and polytechnics  administration perception towards BL diffusion. Hence, there is need for a model to be developed  in assessing institutions administration readiness and such model can be employed by e-learning  administrator\manager and syllabus designer to institutionalize BL practice.

Model and Hypotheses Development This Section aims to provide answer to the first research question; which variables and associated factors influence administrators’ readiness to diffuse BL? Hence, the variables are  identified grounded by the mature implementation stage of diffusion of innovation theory and  institutional BL adoption framework discussed in Section 2.2 and 2.3. Therefore, the identified  variables and related factors includes; 3.1.Institutional Structure The institutional structure involves administration initiating policies that promotes the recognition and accreditation of BL approaches in the institution, thus helping to translate BL  policies into actual implementation (Wong et al., 2014). The role of institutions administration is  not only to provide the needed BL infrastructure but also to foster sustainability of BL initiatives Table 1 Contd. Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203    being adopted in the institution for academic staffs and students (Wong et al., 2014; Yeop, Wong,  and Noh, 2016). Notwithstanding, findings from Yeop et al. (2016) mentioned that although  institution administration is the main component which helps to govern academic staffs and  students, it is the least researched component as compared to studies conducted to explore students  and lecturer’s readiness to adopt BL. Thus, the institutional structure factors relates to the  vision/mission, advocacy, and definition/plan of the institution in regards to their readiness to  adopt BL (Graham et al., 2013; Porter et al., 2014). In terms of the vision and mission, institutions  adopting BL should identify the goals they intend to achieve, which should be based on enhancing  pedagogy, increased BL resources flexibility and access, and lastly improve resource use and cost  effectiveness (Porter et al., 2014). Furthermore, vision and mission relate to the idea that management has agreed to implement BL based on the institution values (Tahir, Said, Ali, Samah, Daud, and Mohtar, 2013).  Also, faculties need to ascertain how their respective departmental goals and educational programs  correspond with the institution's vision and mission if BL initiative is to succeed (Moskal et al.,  2013; Jääskelä, Häkkinen, and Rasku-Puttonen, 2017). Thus, BL is effective when the  administration is committed to improve teaching and learning quality in a cost-effective approach,  then technology can be viewed as a tool to be employed in achieving strategic goal of the institution  (Tahir et al., 2013). Although, findings from Chong et al. (2010) revealed that resistance to  institutional change was mentioned as one of the main factors that inhabits institutions’ ability to  restructure BL policies. In terms of advocacy successful BL diffusion requires advocacy among  faculties, administrators, and staffs. Administration advocates support to develop a shared vision  for BL adoption, extends communication, and allocates needed resources and funding. Thus, administration advocacy provides enthusiasm and cooperation that facilitate BL implementation (Porter et al., 2014). For definition, drafting an institutional BL plan can ease a  number of essential objectives, which entails distinguishing BL approaches from other educational  methods for providing students with reliable and clear prospects regarding BL, and also developing  suitable support strategies (Graham et al., 2013). Correspondingly, Porter et al. (2014) affirmed  that while administration formulating BL definition does not essentially require all lecturers to  follow identical pedagogical structure, a defined plan can simplify a level of consistency.  Likewise, Spring et al. (2016) argued that institution should align its BL definition with its core  objectives while remaining consistent with its institutional vision and mission. Based on the  proceeding discussion we propose that; H1: Institutional structure has a significant influence on administration readiness to diffuse BL. 3.2.Resource Support In the context of this study resource support may be defined as enhancing actions or elements provided for students and academic staffs by administration towards BL adoption. This  variable measures the extent to which enabling environment or conditions exist to promote BL  adoption (Ho, 2017). Furthermore, findings from Ghazal et al. (2018) indicated that administration Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203    support positively determines lecturers’ perception towards the ease of use and usefulness of BL  approaches. Thus, if there are no supports provided to learners in BL environment, they are likely  to become discouraged with using BL approaches for learning (Ghazal et al., 2018). Respectively,  support encompasses issues relating to the way institutions facilitate implementation and  maintenance of BL environment (Yeop et al., 2016). The resources support factors includes  technical support, pedagogical support, financial support, and tenure/promotion (Porter et al.,  2016). Technical support helps to maintain IT facilities and equipment utilized by students and  lecturers for BL activities (Cacciamani et al., 2018). Thus, institutions are required to provide  dedicated support services to assist students and lecturers throughout the use and development of  courses in order to ensure effective BL adoption (Poon, 2014). Results from Ahmed (2010) confirmed that efficient technical and pedagogy support significantly results to higher acceptance of blended e-learning adoption by students and lecturers.  Likewise, results from Porter et al. (2014); Ghazal et al. (2018) indicated that provision of  pedagogy support to lecturers on how to manage blended course content positively influenced their  perception towards using BL for teaching. In addition, students and academics need to be  competent in technology usage in order to adopt BL approaches. As such, it is important to provide  technical skills development to students and lecturer (Poon, 2014).  The provision of financial  support is also necessary to initiate and promote BL initiatives (Garrison and Kanuka, 2004; Porter  et al., 2016). Financial incentives can be provided to motivate academics in adopting BL by  providing workload compensation, remunerations for BL implementation, or financing  technological infrastructures (Graham et al., 2013; Moskal et al., 2013). Thus, policies regarding  reward, tenure, and promotion can be provided to lecturers by institutions to demonstrate their  support and endorsement of BL implementation (Basir et al., 2010; Chong et al., 2010; Porter et  al., 2014). Accordingly, findings from Graham et al. (2013) suggested that providing incentives to  support BL adoption by academics positively increased BL implementation. Based on the  aforementioned discussion we propose that; H2: Resource support positively influences administration readiness to diffuse BL. 3.3.Management Strategies Management strategies outline the overall initiatives to be employed for administration to translate BL policy into actual BL implementation within faculties (Chong et al., 2010). Thus,  administration needs to clearly specify the roles of BL and provide proper direction for faculties  in planning and adopting BL initiatives (Moskal et al., 2013). Moreover, there is need to stipulate  the available method on how BL approaches can be diffused to improve teaching, for example by  providing guidance on asynchronous and synchronous approaches of BL pedagogy to ensure that  students’ academic requirements are achieved (Basir et al., 2010). According to Graham et al.  (2013); Porter et al. (2014) management strategies factors comprises of evaluation, professional  development, governance. Thus, current BL approach needs to be evaluated to assess teaching and  learning performance in identifying weaknesses to be improved. The evaluation can be Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203    periodically employed and follow up actions for improvement should be deployed accordingly and  promptly (Garrison and Kanuka 2004; Basir et al., 2010). Thus, evaluation involves the  perceptions of students regarding lecturers teaching where feedback is collected and presented to  stakeholders (Graham et al., 2013) to be used for future improvement (Chong et al., 2010; Moskal  et al., 2013). Similarly, professional development or as referred to as training is a process by which lecturers and students are equipped with skills  required to accomplish an activity or a task in this  case implementing BL approaches (Lança and Bjerre, 2018). Professional development can be  carried out in the form of workshops, seminars, online tutorials, and short courses (Bowyer, 2017).  Results from Poon (2014); Ghazal et al. (2018) confirmed that training provided to students was  found to be an important factor that promotes the adoption of BL. Thus, Ghazal et al. (2018)  highlighted that lack of training influence students’ learning experience and success of BL  approach. Furthermore, when lecturers are provided with the necessary training and skill, they  perceive BL as easy to use and useful (Chong et al., 2010; Tahir et al., 2013). Thus, BL is most  successful when there is administrative support through the provision of professional development  (Kuar, 2013). Additionally, researchers such as Ghazal et al. (2018) argued that BL is effective  when management governance is aligned to improve the quality of lecturers teaching and student  learning experience in a cost-effective manner. Hence, BL governance should provide clear  policies, more organized distribution of course schedule plan and implementation responsibilities  for the semester (Moskal et al., 2013). Accordingly, we hypothesize that; H3: Management strategies have a significant influence on administration readiness to diffuse BL. 3.4.Technology Infrastructures The first and most primary component in BL adoption is the deployment of necessary infrastructures which includes office space, hardware, software, and internet access (Ahmed,  2010). In BL environment technology infrastructure factors consists of network infrastructure such  as wireless network and high-speed network, software infrastructure that improve access and  flexibility to online and F2F learning, and lastly physical hardware equipment that facilitate BL  (Basir et al., 2010). Moreover, technology infrastructure refers to technical resources that enhance  teaching and learning activities in BL environment (Garrison and Kanuka, 2004). Accordingly,  findings from prior studies (Basir et al., 2010; Al-Busaidi, 2012; Springs et al., 2016; Ghazal et  al., 2018) reported inadequate technological infrastructure as one of the inhibitors of BL  implementation. This setback may be attributed by administration concerns regarding the cost of  deploying and maintaining IT infrastructure (Graham et al., 2013). Accordingly, deploying the  required technological infrastructure is essential for effective BL implementation, thus institutions  seeking to diffuse BL must provide the fundamental technological infrastructure needed for  effective BL implementation (Porter et al., 2014). Respectively, administration should plan with  Information Technology (IT) vendors to ensure they deliver reliable IT infrastructures that always  meet the learning and teaching needs of student and lecturers, and that they have a scalable plan Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203    to improve the infrastructures as demand and usage increase (Moskal et al., 2013). Based on the  literature, the following hypothesis is proposed that; H4: Available technology infrastructures have a positive influence on administration readiness to  diffuse BL. 3.5.Ethical Considerations With increase of online learning resources and materials it is easy to disseminate course materials via the internet, legal and ownership of Intellectual Property (IP) has become an  important issue in BL implementation (Fleck, 2012; Roszak, Kołodziejczak, Kowalewski, and  Ren-Kurc, 2014). Thus, policies need to be institutionalized up front regarding accessibility and  ownership of educational materials (Graham et al., 2013; Moskal et al., 2013). Therefore, BL  policies initiated in the institution should unambiguously state the regulation and rules pertaining  to issues such as ownership of course materials, editing and rights privileges, use fees, royalties,  distribution, circulation of course materials designed by lecturers (Basir et al., 2010). Besides,  institutions adopting BL should determine who approves the development of BL courses and who  owns intellectual property rights to materials created for academics, including matters of  accessibility, and commercial sales of course materials developed by lecturers (Basir et al., 2010;  Porter et al., 2014). Therefore, this study suggests the following hypothesis; H5: Ethical issues to be considered in the institution positively influences administration readiness  to diffuse BL. 3.6.Readiness to Diffuse Blended Learning In this study readiness is a measure of the degree to which the institution administrations may be willing, ready, or prepared to acquire benefits which arise from the deployment of ICT as  BL to support teaching and learning effectiveness (Wong et al., 2014). Institution’s readiness to  adopt BL is reflected in the decision of the administration to incorporate BL approaches into the  current institution curriculum (Machado, 2007; Wong et al., 2014). Therefore, the institution  administration readiness assesses whether processes are put in place to facilitate both students and  lecturers in adopting BL initiatives (Mercado, 2008). The readiness construct provide a goal for  the institution as it assess its capability to diffuse BL in improving teaching and learning  effectiveness. The readiness also measures the current BL status in relation to where the institution  envisions BL to be in future. These important information supports institution administration to  develop policies as well as roadmap for improving BL implementation to enhance teaching and  learning (Mercado, 2008). Therefore, based on the identified variables and associated factors that influence institutions administrators’ readiness to diffuse BL grounded on DoI theory and institutional BL  adoption framework, the model is developed as seen in Figure 3 to assess institutions  administrators’ readiness to diffuse BL in providing answers to the second research questions. Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203  Figure 3 Developed model Figure 3 depicts the developed model to investigate the variables and related factors that influences institutions administration readiness to diffuse BL initiatives.  4. Research Methodology  4.1.Research Context A quantitative research method was employed in this study to examine the effects of the variables (see Figure 3) that influence institutions administrators’ readiness to diffuse BL. This  study adopted confirmatory research approach which involves proposing hypotheses grounded by  prior studies and later testing the hypotheses using statistical method. Thus, in confirmatory  approach hypotheses are generally derived from a theory or the outcomes of previous studies.  Hence, confirmatory research approach was adopted as it provides results that are easily analyzed,  summarized, and tabulated. It also offers freedom and flexibility for participants (Ghazal et al.,  2018). Data was collected from institutions administrators/managers in Malaysia universities,  colleges, and polytechnics (see Table 2), in their mature implementation stage of BL adoption  (Graham et al, 2013). The institutions adopt both F2F weekly classes and e-learning system such  as Moodle, MOOC, Learning Management System (LMS), etc. in teaching and learning process  with a decrease in physical class time. Moreover, each administrators/managers involves in the  data collection process maintains his/her institutions’ e-learning system. Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203    4.2.Data Collection The survey instrument was developed in English language and Bahasa Malayu to ensure that the questionnaires were suitable for all participants. To establish evidence of face and content  validity of the questionnaire, we asked experts (7 IT and 3 education domain) to review the  instrument and determine whether it measures our intended concepts. We also involved one  stakeholder in key positions at a university for further confirmation of the questionnaire to assure  that the instrument was suitable for the context. Next, pilot study was carried out and data was  collected from four e-learning administrators to assess if the participants understand the questions  and to test the reliability of questionnaires instruments. Results from the pilot revealed that the  Cronbach’s alpha was higher than 0.7 which reflects an acceptable level of reliability. Then, links  to the survey was sent to purposive selected e-learning administrators/managers in Malaysia  institutions, where the target sample for this research included e-learning staffs and administrators  that maintains online learning platforms. The e-learning administrators were selected due to their  experience and familiarity with BL environment in providing answers based on their perceptions  and readiness toward BL. Table 2 Institutions involved in the survey Institutions category  Respondents Public University  23 Private University  31 Institute of Teachers Education  2 University College/Institute  8 Polytechnics  159 Total  223  Accordingly, implicit consent was provided to the respondents who completed the survey. The aim and purpose of the study and respondent’s rights not to partake in the survey was clearly  specified. Hence, participation in the survey was voluntary. Then, invitations to participate in the  main survey, including link to the questionnaire, was distributed to e-learning administrators via  emailed and the links was also distributed to various e-learning centers of selected universities,  colleges, and polytechnics in Malaysia from January 2019 to April 2019. The data collection  involves a survey of e-learning administrators in Malaysia institutions as seen in Table 2. On  average, each respondent took not more than 7 minutes to answer all questions. The questionnaire  comprises of two sections. The first section included the demographic question (gender, age, job  title, years of experience in e-learning, nationality, academic qualification, institution name, type,  level, e-learning center name, and year of establishment) measured using continuous or categorical  measurement. The second section is based on the developed model (see Figure 3), where the  questionnaire rates the perception and readiness of the administrators in regards to BL diffusion in  their institutions measured based on a five point Likert-type scale anchored from 1 to 5, where (1  = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, and 5 = strongly agree) similar to AlBusaidi (2012); Ghazal et al. (2018). The questionnaire was developed based on existing  instruments from prior studies (see Table 3).

In principle, each latent variable is expected to have at least 3 items to capture the actual phenomenon or measure the  variable in providing results that can be statistically inferred to get a good fit of the model (Teo,  2019). Thus, in conducting the test in Partial Least Squares (PLS)-Structural Equation Modeling  (SEM) as recommended by Jnr (2019), we used 5000 bootstrapping technique to overcome this  limitation in deploying the statically test. The questionnaire comprised of 38 items, and at the end  of the data collection a total of 223 samples was collected, but 56 samples were excluded due to  incomplete data which resulted to a final 167 usable samples. Table 4 depicts the demographic  characteristics of the survey respondents and their respective institutions.

Data Analysis and Results  5.1.Data Analysis This study employed Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 23 and SEM based on PLS for data analysis. SEM approach was selected because it can be utilized to analyze Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203    all hypotheses in a single analysis (Lin and Wang, 2012). Likewise, SEM was employed in this  research due to its ability to analyze the relationships between the variables and approximate  random errors in the observed constructs directly in providing precise measurements of the  questionnaire items and variables (Teo, 2019). Furthermore, PLS is a latent SEM technique that  uses a component based method for estimation (Anthony Jr, 2019). Thus, PLS-SEM provides two  analyses which include assessment of measurement model (evaluation of reliability and validity  of constructs) and assessment of structural model (validates model variables) (Hair et al., 2016).  SmartPLS version 3.0 was deployed to assess the measurement and the structural model and SPSS  version 23 was employed to carry out descriptive analysis. 5.2.Assessment of Measurement Model This is the first step involved in assessing the developed model (see Figure 3). This step assesses how well the observed questionnaire items measure the unobserved variables as presented  in Table 3 (Teo, 2019). The measurement model was evaluated based on descriptive analysis, item  loadings, reliability measures, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. 5.2.1. Descriptive, Convergent Validity, and Reliability SPSS was employed to check the descriptive statistics for all constructs. Results from Table 5 indicate that the mean values are higher than 2.5 based on a 5 point scale. Moreover, the Standard  Deviation (SD) are lower than 1 and close to 0 indicating a narrow spread between the mean  indicating that the responses from the respondents are close, and not widely dispersed (Anthony,  Abdul Majid, and Romli, 2018b). The data was also screened to confirm normality by checking the  Skewness and Kurtosis values. The values of the Skewness and Kurtosis for the items were  between the recommended cutoffs of 3.0 for Skewness and 8.0 for Kurtosis as recommended by  Teo (2019).

Likewise, validity  refers to the extent to which a variable differs from other variables in the same model in measuring  what it supposed to measure (Yeou, 2016).

In addition, results in Table 6 show the reliability measure based Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203    on the Composite Reliability (CR) and Cronbach’s alpha score which should be greater than 0.70  for CR and Cronbach’s alpha (Hair et al., 2016; Anthony, Abdul Majid, and Romli, 2018a). Besides,  convergent validity, which specifies that a set of items corresponds to one and the same underlying  variable, was assessed as seen in Table 6 based on the values of the Average Variance Extracted  (AVE) which should be greater than 0.50 denoting that a variable is able to explain more than 50%  variance of its items (Fornell and Larcker, 1981; Hair et al., 2016). 5.2.2. Discriminant Validity Discriminant validity relates to the level of difference between the sets of variables and their own items\indicators. In this regard, Hair et al. (2016) mentioned that the correlations  between items in two variables should not be higher than the square root of the mean variance  shared by a single variable’s items. To assess for discriminant validity, the Fornell and Larcker  (1981) test was employed, where this test checks if the square root of AVE of each variable exceeds  the correlation shared between the variables and other variables in the model. Moreover, the AVE  value should be greater than 0.50 for all variables measuring 50% variance (Anthony Jr, Abdul  Majid, and Romli, 2018). Table 7 Discriminate validity Variables  Ethical Consideration Institutional Structure Management Strategies Readiness to  Diffuse BL Resource  Support Technology Infrastructure Ethical Consideration  0.916  Institutional Structure  0.436  0.837  Management Strategies  0.726  0.545  0.757  Readiness to Diffuse BL  -0.002  0.105  0.061  0.879  Resource Support  0.657  0.541  0.724  0.089  0.714  Technology  Infrastructure 0.745  0.570  0.755  0.073  0.627  0.811  Results from Table 7 indicate that all variables acceptably higher than 0.5 and the square root of the AVE (on the diagonal) are larger than the cross-correlations with other variables. 5.3.Assessment of Structural Model The assessment of the structural model is carried out to test the relationships in the model in confirming the model hypotheses as seen in Figure 3. The structural model assessment is  measured by examining the path coefficients value (β) which evaluates the association between  constructs based on their degree of corresponding significant levels (p-value) using PLS path  modeling technique. Furthermore, the coefficient of determination known as 𝑅2 value which is an  assessment of the model’s predictive power is calculated based on the squared correlation between  the variables in the model. The literature (Baragash and Al-Samarraie, 2018) recommended that  𝑅2 values of 0.67, 0.33, and 0.19 were regarded as excellent, average, and low, respectively.  Likewise, Salloum, Al-Emran, Shaalan, and Tarhini (2019) suggested that the 𝑅2 value should be  greater than 0.10 to be acceptable. Lastly, bootstrapping techniques in PLS based on 5000 samples Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203    was employed to measure the level of significance of the paths (t-value) which should be higher  than 1.96 for two-tail test as previously employed by Anthony, Abdul Majid, and Romli (2018b).  Thus, results of path coefficient, standard error, 𝑅2, β, t, and p-value shown in Table 8 and Figure  4 is used to validate the developed model hypotheses (H1-H5). Table 8 Results of hypotheses (H1-H5) Hypotheses  Path Description  Standard  Error (SE) Path Coefficient Beta (β) 𝑹𝟐  t-value  Significance  level (p-value) Results H1  Institutional Structure ->  Readiness to Diffuse BL 0.048  0.712  0.507  13.877  0.000  Supported H2  Resource Support ->  Readiness to Diffuse BL 0.030  0.894  0.799  27.273  0.000  Supported H3  Management Strategies ->  Readiness to Diffuse BL 0.042  0.951  0.904  41.924  0.000  Supported H4  Technology Infrastructure > Readiness to Diffuse BL 0.023  0.930  0.865  34.677  0.000  Supported H5  Ethical Consideration ->  Readiness to Diffuse BL 0.027  0.875  0.765  24.657  0.000  Supported Decision: Hypothesis is supported if t-value = > 1.96 and p-value = <0.05   Figure 4 Results of the structural model. Note: **p < 0.05 Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203 Results from Table 8 and Figure 4 show the significance testing of the model hypotheses presented in Figure 3. H1 states that institutional structure has a significant influence on  administration readiness to diffuse BL. Results from Table 8 show that H1 path coefficient is 0.712  (t=13.877, p=0.000), therefore supporting H1 since t-value is greater than 1.96 benchmark and  path coefficient is higher than “0” (Anthony Jr, 2019). Similarly, H2 states that resource support  positively influences administration readiness to diffuse BL. Results from Table 8 further suggest  that H2 path coefficient is 0.894 (t=27.273, p=0.000), therefore supporting H2. Next, H3 states  that management strategies have a significant influence on administration readiness to diffuse BL.  Accordingly, results from Table 8 disclose that the hypothesis is significant where path coefficient  is 0.951 (t=41.924, p=0.000). Similarly, results from Table 8 reveal that available technology  infrastructures have a positive influence on administration readiness to diffuse BL (H4) with path  coefficient of 0.930 (t=34.677, p=0.000). Likewise, the results confirm H5 which suggest that  ethical issues to be considered in the institution positively influences administration readiness to  diffuse BL with path coefficient of 0.875 (t=24.657, p=0.000). In addition, results from Table 7 show that the 𝑅2 values ranges from H1= 0.507, H2= 0.799, H3= 0.904, H4= 0.865, H5= 0.765. The result suggests that all 𝑅2 values are higher than  0.1 as recommended by Salloum et al. (2019) and ranges from H3 with 0.904 suggesting that  management strategies predicts 90.4% of  administration readiness to diffuse BL. Next, is H4 with  0.865, indicating that the technological infrastructure explains 86.5% variance of administration  readiness to diffuse BL. Followed by H2 with 0.799, thus explaining 79.9% variance of  administration readiness to diffuse BL and then its H5 with 0.765 predicting 76.65% variance of  administration readiness to diffuse BL and lastly its H1 with 0.507 which explains on 50.7%  variance of administration readiness to diffuse BL. The results indicate that all hypotheses have an  average to excellent 𝑅2 values (Baragash and Al-Samarraie, 2018). The results empirically  confirm that H3 has the strongest effect, thus evaluation, professional development, and  governance policies are more important to be adopted if administration wants to diffuse BL in their  respective institutions. 5.4.Importance Performance Map Analysis (IPMA) Accordingly, academicians such as Chin (1998); Anthony et al. (2018b) mentioned that researchers should not only confirm if there is a significant relationship among the variables or  not, but also check the size of effect between the variables. Thus, in addition to confirming  hypotheses there is need to check the model’s effect size which measures the percentage of the  importance and impact levels of the identified variables influence on the readiness of  administration to adopt BL approaches 𝑅2 values. Where, the effect size assesses the strength of  correlation among the variables. This helps in providing answer to the last research question what  are the importance and impact levels of the identified variables? thus confirming the complete  impact of the study. Hence, Importance-Performance Map Analysis (IPMA) was deployed  analogous to prior BL study (Bervell and Umar, 2018) as seen in Figure 5 to test for total effect  for importance (values inside the circles) and impact levels (values on the line) of the variables. Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203  Figure 5 Results for importance-performance map analysis Results from IPMA test in SmartPLS3 as depict in Figure 5 reveal the test of total effect of the developed model (see Figure 3) suggesting that institutional structure is the most influencing  variable that influence institutions administrators’ readiness to diffuse BL with total effect of  0.116. This result confirms findings from prior studies (Graham et al., 2013; Porter et al., 2014)  which stated that institutional structure which comprises of purpose, definition, and advocacy  towards BL is one of the main factors that influence institutional management to adopt and  implement BL. Similarly, results from Figure 5 suggest that institutional structure is the most  performing variable with value of 77.830, signifying that the current institutional BL structure  employed in universities, colleges, and polytechnics is the most important variable that determines  the institutionalization of BL.  5.5.Discussion BL provides an efficient approach for lecturers to teach and students to learn, thus offering academic institutions with a medium to store, share, and manage academic knowledge and  resources. Although, BL is deployed by academic staffs and students in higher educations, its  survival in the long run depends on the commitment and support of institutional administration. Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203    Accordingly, this study develops a model to examine variables and associated factors that  influence institutions administration readiness to diffuse BL initiatives. Data was collected using  survey questionnaire from e-learning administrators/managers in Malaysia universities, colleges,  and polytechnics. PLS-SEM was employed to analyze the collected data in validating the  developed model hypotheses. The result confirms H1, suggesting that there is a significant  relationship between institutional structure and administration readiness to diffuse BL. This result  is consistent with work of prior studies (Moskal et al., 2013; Tahir et al., 2013; Porter et al., 2014)  who mentioned that policies provided by institutions’ administrator helps to develop and facilitate  BL adoption. More specifically, the results point out that administrators’ advocation provide  enthusiasm and cooperation that supports BL adoption in their institution to deliver the needed  structural resource supports for teaching and learning (Tahir et al., 2013). Additionally, creating a  definition of BL can ease in achieving learning objectives for scheduling lectures, providing  students with reliable and clear prospects regarding BL approach, and developing suitable support  initiatives (Moskal et al., 2013). With respect to H2, resource support influence on administration readiness to diffuse BL, the result shows a significant relationship, where this result is consistent with those reported by  previous studies (Ahmed, 2010; Carbonell et al., 2013; Ghazal et al., 2018) which confirmed the  effectiveness of management support in promoting BL adoption. In this regard, resource support  which entails provisions of sufficient resources to support students achieve their learning goals  and lecturers in improving their teaching is important in improving BL diffusion (Poon, 2014;  Yeop et al., 2016). Thus, if there is no support provided to promote BL, students and lecturers are  not likely to be motivated to adopt BL (Basir et al.  2010). Regarding H3 which relates to the  positive and significant impact of management strategies on the readiness of administration to  institutionalize BL, our results agree with those found by Chong et al. (2010); Graham et al. (2013);  Kuar (2013); Porter et al. (2014); Bowyer (2017). In fact, as observed by Tahir et al. (2013)  management strategies comprises of institutional educational committee members concerned with  overseeing the adoption of BL. Institutional management defines strategies related to improving  the sustainable and effective use of IT to achieve established BL goals (Graham et al., 2013; Porter  et al., 2014). In addition, administrators should have a strategic roadmap to help determine who  approves how BL courses are to be taught in the institution such as the ration of 20-80, 30-70, or  40-60 for F2F and online learning (Chong et al., 2010; Poon, 2014). Besides, for H4 our result regarding the relationship between available technology infrastructures and administration readiness to diffuse BL are in line with the research conducted  by Basir et al. (2010); Al-Busaidi (2012); Springs et al. (2016); Ghazal et al. (2018), which also  reported positive direct effect. In this sense, our result indicates that the deployment of required  technological infrastructure is essential for effective BL adoption (Porter et al. 2014). Similarly,  the result is analogous with findings from the literature (Ahmed, 2010; Porter et al., 2014) where  the authors stated that management decisions to invest in technologies predicts effective BL  adoption in higher education. Thus, it is obvious that institutions seeking to adopt BL must provide  basic technological infrastructure necessary for effective BL adoption (Moskal et al., 2013). In  addition, for H5 the result reveal that ethical issues to be considered in the institution significantly  predict administration readiness to diffuse BL. This result supports the conclusion made by Fleck Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203    (2012); Moskal et al. (2013). One possible explanation for this result is that BL policies initiated  in institutions that explicitly state the rules and regulation relating to ownership of course materials,  editing, circulation, and rights privileges of learning course materials designed by lecturers will  influence how such materials are disseminated and utilized for teaching and learning (Roszak et  al., 2014). Thus, it can be anticipated that providing ethical considerations polices initiated by the  institution will motivate academic staffs to design and develop improved educational resources  and course materials (Graham et al., 2013), that can be easily disseminated over the internet during  blended courses. Hence, lecturers’ original idea is saved, and this protects the institutions from  future legal issues (Basir et al., 2010).  6. Implications of Study  6.1.Theoretical Implications This article provides useful insights and implications for academicians, educators, and policy makers on BL diffusion in higher education mainly from the administration perspective.  Respectively, this study develops a model to investigate the variables and factors that influence  institutions administration readiness to diffuse BL initiatives based on diffusion of innovation  theory and institutional BL adoption framework that comprise of mature implementation stage of  BL. Specifically by adopting the developed model, universities, colleges, and polytechnics will be  able to better identify institutional strategy, support, and structure initiatives that provides  information based on the variables and related factors (see Figure 3) to determine their progress in  diffusing BL initiatives. In addition, the model provides awareness on issues institutions should  consider to successfully transiting from exploration/awareness of BL to early implementation and  eventually mature implementation. In this study, the authors have outlined a number of variables (institutional structure, resource support, management strategies, technology infrastructure, and ethical consideration) and  associated factors to institutionalize BL policy in higher education. It is evident that the diffusion  of BL in institutions requires support from management as well as consistent student learning and  lecturers teaching support mechanisms. Findings from this study suggest that the variables  presented in the developed model should be adopted by administration based on the factors and  derived items (as seen in Table 3) in achieving an institutional culture that is both reliable and  responsive in diffusing BL approaches. Obviously, the diffusion of BL initiatives in any institution  relies on adequate investment of technical, pedagogical, financial support. Likewise, our results  confirm the necessity of providing adequate pedagogical and technical support not only for  academic staffs, but also for students who may lack the required skills needed to succeed when  employing BL approach for teaching and learning. Grounded on institutional BL adoption framework by Graham et al. (2013) which comprises of strategy, support, and structure key recommendations from this study advocates for  institutional administration to establish a common BL implementation vision/mission, provide  resources, and define teaching and learning outcomes. Furthermore, findings from this study Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203    suggest that institutions should include the need to adequately deploy technological infrastructure  that facilitates BL diffusion as well as the need to provide pedagogical and technical training to  support transformation of F2F courses to fully BL experiences in an approach that assimilates the  best elements of offline and online learning. Moreover, findings from this study provide effective  resources to support BL initiatives in providing information that supports effective decision  making at both instructional and policy levels. Thus, our findings provide a roadmap to guide  institutions to strategically diffuse BL in higher educational institutions. 6.2.Practical Implications Findings from this study offer some practical implications for educationalist, researchers, and educational management. Practically, the developed model supports the assessment of  administrators’ readiness to diffuse BL approaches available in their respective institutions and  how the impact will be measured either before any adoption occurs or based on their current  implementation policies. First, it is important for administrators to become aware of how to best  diffuse BL approaches and how they can take control and manage the overall BL implementation  in their institutions. Findings from this study can be utilized to guide institutions in both developed  and developing countries to initiate effective debates and discussions that shape discourse on BL  continuity. In addition, the developed model can be adopted to design policies, practices, and  develop a culture that supports continuance improvement of BL approaches in universities,  colleges, and polytechnics. Moreover, this study provides insights on how to improve the quality  of institutionalizing BL adoption in Malaysia higher learning towards enhancing the current state  of the art and state of BL initiatives. The model developed can be deployed as a tool based on the derived factors and items as developed in Table 3 to inform decisions made by policy makers, stakeholders, and governments  in improving the performance and quality of teaching, research and education in enhancing the  quality of learning in Malaysian academic units and beyond. Since higher education in Malaysia  and other neighboring countries in Asia and other continents initiates educational managerial  committee that oversee the running of BL as well as F2F learning. The factors can be deployed as  checklist to assess the current educational teaching and learning systems. Moreover, specific  academic units such as the internal and external monitoring and evaluation department that exists  in higher education worldwide established by the Ministry of education such as in Malaysia that  accredits teaching and learning approaches could particularly benefit from the model to perform  inspections and certifications of BL approaches diffused in various institutions across the world. Specifically, this study provides pertinent strategy, support, and structure to institutions interested in diffusing BL with information concerning how their decisions regarding F2F and  online learning may influence administration adoption. Correspondingly, findings from this study  are important to be utilized as a reference for the organizing methodologies to embrace BL in  Malaysia and other countries such as US, Canada, Australia, etc. institutions. This article provide  insight to institution’s top management on their adaptability and readiness for future  implementation of BL approaches by identifying administrations readiness to diffuse BL practice  in their respective institutions. Additionally, the developed model also provides insights for  administrators on institutional factors needed to support diffusion of BL by empowering innovate Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203    use of BL and supports cross-disciplinary practice-based approach to create and inform  institutional-wide practices for BL adoption. The study contributes to a better understanding of BL initiatives from the lens of administrators and offers insights to institution managers in improving blended course  management towards enriching teaching and learning quality in refining institutional strategies.  Thus, the model can be employed as a guide to plan, develop, deliver, manage, and evaluate BL  programs for higher education.  Furthermore, this is one of a few studies that provide evidence and  concept regarding institutional administration readiness to evaluate if processes are in place to  facilitate students and academic staffs learning and teaching. Therefore, the model can evaluate  institutions administration plan, technical (hardware, educational software, network access),  pedagogical, and financial commitment towards diffusing BL practice in their institutions. Thus, this study proposed a readiness concept to provide a goal for institutions towards developing their capability to adopt BL approaches. Respectively, the developed model can be  utilized to assess the current status of higher educations in relation to where the management  envisions the institution to be based on an already set milestone. Lastly, the instrument developed  in Table 3 can be employed as a benchmarking academic performance application based on each  variable and factors to provide vital information on program/course design or revision to develop  initiatives as well as schedule for assessing their readiness to diffuse BL in their respective  institutions. Also, this provides a link to align the findings from this study to real world practices  in higher education.  7. Conclusion Currently, there are fewer studies that investigated the involvement of educational managers and administrators to assess the level of readiness of their institutions towards diffusing  BL initiatives which possess the capability to address a number of teaching and learning challenges  faced in higher education. Therefore, there is need for strategic institutional changes which will  only occur if there is a shared mission, vision, and purpose within the institution. Yet, prior studies  mainly focused on issues related to students and academic staffs in improving teaching and  learning effectiveness, only few studies focused on institution’s readiness and diffusion issues.  Accordingly, this study develops a model based on diffusion of innovation theory and institutional  BL adoption framework to investigate variables and factors that influence institutions  administration readiness to diffuse BL initiatives to examine the growth or mature BL  implementation in Malaysia universities, colleges, and polytechnics. The developed model was validated based on data collected using a survey questionnaire instrument from e-learning administrators/managers in Malaysia universities, colleges, and  polytechnics. After which the collected data was analyzed using PLS-SEM. Overall, the results  reveal that the institutional structure, management strategies, resource support, technology  infrastructure, and ethical consideration significantly predicts administration readiness to diffuse  BL. Moreover, results from the survey data indicate that institutional strategy is the most important  and performing variable that enhances administration readiness to diffuse BL in their institution. Post-print version of the paper by Bokolo Jr, A. et al. in Journal of Research on Technology in Education,  (2019) 1-28 http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1080/15391523.2019.1675203    Although, innovation in BL practices may bring abrupt changes in teaching and learning, bridging  the gap between F2F and online mainly depends on the attitude, willingness and motivation of  institution management towards BL initiatives. Irrespective of the contribution from this study, there are limitations that are worth mentioning. First, the sample was collected from Malaysia institutions only. Thus, more research  is required to be carried out in institutions from different countries to improve the results and  provide more significant insights into administration diffusion of BL approaches. Secondly, there  is need to examine other related factors that are not included in DOI theory and Institutional BL  adoption framework such as the culture, norms, etc. Third, in this study, data was collected using  survey questionnaire instrument only, thus there is need to employ case study to collect data using  interview instrument as employed by prior BL studies (Machado, 2007; Carbonell et al., 2013;  Garrison and Vaughan, 2013; Graham et al., 2013; Moskal et al., 2013; Taylor and Newton, 2013;  Porter et al., 2014; Spring et al., 2016; Porter et al., 2016), to supplement the survey data in  providing more insight regarding the variables and factors that predicts administration readiness  toward BL diffusion. Thus, interview instrument will be designed based on the derived factors to  collect qualitative data from top institutions leader in Malaysia institutions to carry out explorative  study of the current BL approach diffused in various institutions. Besides, such interviews data might draw from the growth maturity or implementation spectrum of BL adopters or focus on either exploration/awareness or early adoption. Moreover,  there is need to collect data from top institutions leader such as Deans, Departments Chairs,  Academic Program Coordinators since the data was collected from mainly e-learning directors,  managers and coordinators. Additionally, there is need for further examine the importance and  impact levels of the identified variables by employing another empirical test such as chi-square  test or Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) analysis in another statistical tool  such as SEM-AMOS to corroborate and strengthen the results from Importance Performance Map  Analysis for effect size determinations towards improving the construct validity of the  questionnaire instrument and third research question. Lastly, the questionnaire items employed to  measure the developed model will be utilized to implement a practical BL assessment tool for  administrators/policymakers to evaluate their readiness to adopt BL in their institutions.
