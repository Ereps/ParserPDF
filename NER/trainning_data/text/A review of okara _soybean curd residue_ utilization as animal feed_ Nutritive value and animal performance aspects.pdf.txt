Okara is one of the by-products, and it is aninsoluble portion of the soybean. It consists of high moisture (8.4–22.9%); on drymatter basis, it contains high metabolizable energy (9.0–14.2 MJ/kg) and other com-ponents that include crude protein (20.9–39.1%), crude fiber (12.2–61.3%), crude fat(4.9–21.5%), and ash (3.4–5.3%). Fermentation of okara improves its nutritional qual-ity and reduces its anti-nutrient contents. Due to animals’ palatability, okara can beused to replace the soybean meal/concentrate feed partially or completely in rumi-nant’s diet and partially in nonruminant’s diet. Okara feeding does not depress theintake, digestibility, growth, milk production, blood metabolic profiles, and meat qual-ity of animals. However, this by-product decays quickly due to its high moisture con-tent, and its heavy weight and sticky nature make it difficult to process andexpensive to dry using conventional methods. This paper thoroughly summarizes theutilization of okara as animal feed in the cause of developing a general guideline withfavorable levels of inclusion in the diets of animals for its exploitation and valoriza-tion. This review will encourage further research to develop eco-friendly and valueadded feed for animals.K E Y W O R D S animal performance, anti-nutrients, chemical composition, fermentation, okara1 | INTRODUCTIONFeed shortage in developing countries is a main concern for the devel-opment of the animal industry, and this shortage is expected toincrease year by year. To overcome the feed problems, farmersfrequently use locally available alternative feed sources, such asagro-industrial by-products. Due to the increasing trend in humanpopulation, the amount of by-products will continue to increase in thefuture. These by-products may have little value as human food, butthey can be extensively fed to animals. Okara is a household andagro-industrial by-product, the left over that remains after the makingof soya products such as soymilk and tofu. It is a white or yellowishpulp consisting insoluble portion (shell, hull, or husk) of soybean.Furthermore, it has many synonyms, depending on the usage or con-text, such as soya waste, draff, tofukasu, soy pulp, soybean curd resi-due, ampas tahu (Malaysian/Indonesian), douzha (Chinese), bejee(Korean), soybean-curd lees, sapal (Filipino), tempe gembus, or tofucake (Amaha et al., 1996; Faisal et al., 2016; O’Toole, 1999).About 0.8, 2.8, 0.01, and 14 million metric tons of okara are dis-posed annually for making soymilk and tofu in Japan, China, Singaporeand worldwide, respectively (Boh, 2017; Choi et al., 2015; Liet al., 2013). Grizotto et al. (2010) estimated that about 7 metric tonsof soymilk and 2 metric tons of okara are generated from 1 metric tonof soybeans. A significant amount of water is needed for tofuprocessing which results in a greater amount of okara and liquid waste(Amaha et al., 1996). As a result, okara contains a significant amountReceived: 19 January 2021 Revised: 29 May 2021 Accepted: 4 June 2021DOI: 10.1111/asj.13594Anim Sci J. 2021;92:e13594. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/asj © 2021 Japanese Society of Animal Science 1 of 16 https://doi.org/10.1111/asj.13594of water (77.7%), as well as water-insoluble components (protein,fiber, fat and mineral), which makes it susceptible to spoilage(Harthan & Cherney, 2017; Rahman et al., 2015; Vong & Liu, 2016). Inaddition, okara is difficult to handle and transport due to its high mois-ture and sticky nature.Those not knowing how to utilize okara accordingly burn theresource as fuel, dump it inside landfills or throw it in rivers whichcontribute to environmental pollution due to its rapid putrefaction. Alot of money is put aside for disposing okara; in Japan, the cost ofokara disposal is about 16 billion yen per annum (Muroyamaet al., 2006). The proper method of using this by-product is by using itin huge quantities (45%) as livestock feed, especially for pigs and dairycows (Fibria, 2007; Gupta et al., 2018; Sinha et al., 2013; Wlek &Zollitsch, 2004), and fertilizer, while relatively small amount (5%) ashuman food. Due to its quick putrefaction and high cost of drying, asignificant portion (50%) of okara is directly destroyed by incinerationor dumped in landfills (Corp, 2020; Pan et al., 2018; Sugiuraet al., 2009; Vong & Liu, 2016).The aim of this review paper is to focus on the chemical composi-tion of okara and its proper utilization as animal feed to evaluate thefeeding effect on the animal performance especially in terms of feedintake, digestibility, growth, milk production, reproduction, and meatquality.2 | PROCESS OF OBTAINING OKARA FROM SOYBEANSSoybeans can be processed by these steps: (1) washing; (2) dipping;(3) milling; (4) boiling; (5) filtration; and (6) residue from filtrationtreated with hot water gives soybean milk and okara. Coagulant isthen added to the soybean milk to give tofu and waste water (liquidwaste) (Amaha et al., 1996); thus, okara is generated along theprocess.3 | POTENTIAL INTERESTSSoybean-based products are being increasingly consumed worldwidedue to its health benefits for humans. Proper utilization of okara willlead to mutual benefits between farmers and manufacturers, since itprovides good nutrients for animal consumption and usage of okara inthis way eliminates disposal problem, reducing environmental pollu-tion. For the purpose of reducing the environmental impacts resultingfrom residue generation, animal scientists and food technologists arelooking for alternatives to the use of agro-industrial by-products as asource of nutrients (Guimaraes et al., 2018; Rahman et al., 2020).Okara has an immense potential to be used as animal feed, fertilizer,and human foods due to its high nutritional and biological value. Whileusing okara as an animal feed, there are several benefits: (i) reduceenvironmental pollution, (ii) promote a more sustainable productionsystem, (iii) provide with increased availability of nutritious feedstuffsfor livestock, (iv) reduce human competition for feed by reducing theamount of feedgrains fed to livestock, and (v) help to keep the cost oflivestock products low.4 | PRESENTATION FORM AND POTENTIAL WAYS OF PROCESSINGIt is difficult to preserve the fresh wet okara due to its high mois-ture content (70%–85%) (Li et al., 2013; Thakur et al., 2016). Dueto high moisture content, its shelf-life under aerobic condition isvery short. Hence, wet okara should be fed to the animals as soonas possible and should not be kept more than 3 days. Otherwise,undesirable microorganisms such as mold and fungus can grow in it,which may cause an unpleasant odor. To overcome this problem,any of the following methods may be chosen to store the okaralonger:a. Dry the okara using sunlight. The disadvantage of this is that theokara may take longer periods to dry if the hours of sunlight in aday are short, and that there is a risk of okara rotting if there is nosufficient amount of sunlight hours. Moreover, if rains are frequentand insects are abundant, it is not feasible to propose sun-drying.A countermeasure against this is by speeding up the drying processby mixing wet okara with dry feed ingredients like rice bran.b. Preserve it by making of silage. The best method of doing this is tosundry it or mix it with other dry feed ingredients before making itinto silage, as this can reduce the moisture content of the okara upto 75%, and then storing it in an air-tight silo for at least 21 days.The benefit of using this method is that okara will not have to bedelivered frequently to farms in fear of the okara rotting and,therefore, being rendered useless. Ensiling may be a practical alter-native and it can improve the nutritive value of okara.c. Preserve it in a freezer (0% to 20C) to inhibit the growth ofpathogenic microorganisms.d. Dry (>85% dry matter) it in an oven at a low temperature or in avacuum freeze. The available drying methods include the jet-spouted bed of sorbent particles method (Wachiraphansakul &Devahastin, 2007), air jet impingement drying (Wang et al., 2016),convective drying (Perussello et al., 2009), and flash drying(Grizotto & de Aguirre, 2011). Drying temperature should be about55C to stimulate enzymatic hydrolysis with the pH of okaramaintained at 9.0 (Hui & Biani, 2018). Thus, dry okara with mini-mum moisture content (14–22%) can be achieved using appropri-ate drying methods. However, drying in an oven is hard to access,if use of okara is focused on soybean processing countries, in lowdeveloped systems.The above mentioned drying methods require special equipmentand high energy, which may be considered uneconomic and unfeasible(Redondo-Cuenca et al., 2008). Moreover, its flavor, color and aromamay also be altered. Thus, more studies are needed to find out themost appropriate drying methods that will both reduce okara’s mois-ture and avoid any alteration in its flavor, color and aroma.2 of 16 RAHMAN ET AL.5 | POSSIBLE FORMS OF UTILIZATIONOkara can be fed to animals as fresh, dried, and ensiled forms. It canbe used as a sole source of concentrate or incorporated with otherfeed ingredients such as corn, rice bran and forage crops when beingfed to animals (Rahman et al., 2015; Rahman et al., 2020). Due to thesticky nature of okara, there is a possibility of it sticking in the holesof the feeder, which will enable the growth of pathogenic microorgan-isms, and which will ultimately cause detrimental effects on animalhealth. Therefore, special attention should be taken when cleaningthe feeder where wet or ensiled okara was placed.6 | NUTRITIVE VALUESOkara serves as a source of both energy and protein for livestock,which is either fed alone or mixed with other feed ingredients to makea complete supplement. The composition of okara may vary widelybased on different processing methods (Li et al., 2013). Due to theseveral steps of processing as mentioned above, a significant amountof okara and liquid waste can be generated from the soybeanprocessing factories. Although the liquid waste contains very highorganic substances, there still remains a high level of nutrients inokara after the filtration. Okara is high in fiber because it is composedmainly of ruptured cotyledon cells and outer layer of the seed. Liquidwaste is generally discharged into the river without any treatment,while okara is used for various purposes due to the following nutri-tional properties:6.1 | Dry matterAs shown in Table 1, okara contains low levels of drymatter (DM) ranging from 8.4% to 22.9%, since making of soya prod-ucts from soybean is involved in filtration process with water, and theratio of water and soybean is usually between 8:1 and 10:1(Liu, 1997). Apparently, a major problem of utilization of this by-product is its high water content, which limits handling, preservation,feeder’s maintenance and even intake.6.2 | Crude proteinAs shown in Table 1, okara contains significant amount of crude pro-tein (CP) with ranges of 15.2% to 39.1% on a DM basis. Liet al. (2013) also mentioned that the CP content in okara ranged fromT A B L E 1 Chemical composition (%) of okaraDry matter Crude proteina Crude fibera Asha Ether extracta NDFa References22.9 23.3 3.7 37.4 Rahman et al.

This variation might have occurred due to the use ofdifferent amounts of water for extraction process, which affects theamount of soluble protein portions being washed away with the liquidwaste. Soybean meal has been applied as a protein source for live-stock and poultry worldwide because it contains significant amount(45%) of CP.Due to farmers feeding soybean meal to both ruminants and non-ruminants, the feed price of soybean meal is increasing because of itshigh demand. Soybean meal can be replaced with okara for ruminants,which will decrease the demand for soybean meal and find usefulnessfor okara. According to NRC (1996), ruminants require more than7.0% CP in their diet for normal ruminal microbial activity. InadequateCP levels may cause reduced growth of ruminal microorganism andsubsequently low productivity of the animal.Many farmers in developing countries offer low quality forage likeNapier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) (<7.0% CP) to ruminants whichdoes not fulfill the protein requirement of ruminants. If protein is notsupplemented properly, animals will not be able to perform optimalproductivity levels. Fortunately, low quality forage with supplementa-tion of okara has the ability to solve this problem (Rahmanet al., 2015; Rahman et al., 2020).Amino acid composition (mg/g of protein) of okara is shown inTable 2 as reported by Colletti et al. (2020). One disadvantage ofokara is that methionine and cysteine are found scarcely in it asreported by Ma et al. (1996). This by-product also contains lowerlysine content than soybean meal (Kim et al., 2012). The biggest dif-ference between okara and soybean meal is tryptophan. Tryptophanis about 55.5% less found in okara compared to soybean meal (Diaz-Vargas et al., 2016). For nonruminants, careful attention should betaken for their ration formulation (if okara is used) since they cannotsynthesize amino acids by their body mechanism.Waliszewski et al. (2002) reported that the ratio of essentialamino acids to total amino acids is similar among soybean milk, okaraand bean curd. As shown in Table 3, fermentation using probiotics canenhance okara’s nutrient values, especially in the increase of aminoacids (Rashad et al., 2011; Tian et al., 2020).6.3 | FiberAs shown in Table 1, okara has high and extremely variable propor-tions of crude fiber (CF) with a range of 12.1 to 61.3% and neutraldetergent fiber (NDF) with a range of 12.7%–72.6% on a DM basis.The variability is so high that makes doubts about the possibility ofbeing the same product; however, this may have occurred due to theuse of various processing methods by soybean manufacturers.Soluble fibers of okara can be increased using different processessuch as fermentation, chemical/enzymatic treatment, high pressure,extrusion, etc. Various processing techniques can increase the nutri-ents of the insoluble portion of the okara and enhance its palatabilityprior to being fed to animals. Because of its high fiber content, theinclusion of okara in poultry diet should be limited so as to preventthe animals (under the poultry section) from getting an inadequatediet. This high fiber content can be partially degraded in ruminantsdue to the presence of rumen microorganism. Dong et al. (2005)reported that okara contains much more fiber than soybean meal.Feeding of okara to ruminants will contribute to decreasing of thecompetition of soybean meal purchasing between ruminant farmersT A B L E 2 Amino acid composition (mg/g of protein) of okara (Colletti et al., 2020)Amino acids ContentAspartic acid 117Threonine 41Serine 50Glutamic acid 195Glycine 46Alanine 46Cysteine + methionine 26Valine 51Isoleucine 51Leucine 81Tyrosine + phenylalanine 95Lysine 65Histidine 28Arginine 75Proline 36Tryptophan Not determinedT A B L E 3 Effect of fermentation with probiotics on free amino acid composition (mg/100 g) in okara (Tian et al., 2020)Composition Unfermented okara Fermented okaraAspartic acid 0.49 0.68Threonine 0.22 0.33Serine 0.28 0.40Glutamic acid 0.68 1.17Glycine 0.14 0.20Alanine 0.28 0.55Valine 0.25 0.34Cysteine 2.31 3.32Isoleucine 0.11 0.22Leucine 0.35 0.68Tyrosine 0.16 0.30Phenylalanine 0.25 0.39Lysine 0.29 0.30Histidine 0.38 0.41Arginine 0.44 0.51Proline 0.32 0.52Total free amino acids 6.26 10.424 of 16 RAHMAN ET AL.and poultry farmers, and which may lead to the reduction of the pricesoybean meal.6.4 | Ether extractAs shown in Table 1, okara contains a significant amount of crude fat,that being a range from 4.9% to 21.5% of DM. Mateos-Aparicioet al. (2010) reported that the fatty acids in okara mostly consists oflinoleic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, α-linolenic acid and stearic acid,which represents 54.1%, 20.4%, 12.3%, 8.8%, and 4.7% of total fattyacids, respectively. The content of fat in okara is quite high and vari-able, which may limit inclusion of okara in ruminant diet, since morethan 70 g fat/kg DM intake may depress fiber digestion and affectruminant animal metabolism (Palmquist, 1994).6.5 | MineralsAs shown in Table 1, okara contains crude ash with a range between3.4% and 5.3%. Vong and Liu (2016) reported that okara containedvarious types of minerals (Table 4). The concentrations of calcium(Ca) were 0.26%–0.43% (Vong & Liu, 2016), and the concentrationsof Ca and phosphorus (P) were 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively, on a DMbasis (Marlina & Askar, 2004). In contrast, Harthan and Cherney (2017)reported that okara contains 2.3% Ca and 4.6% P. Dong et al. (2005)reported that okara contains higher Ca content (1.2%) than that insoybean meal (0.4%), while soybean meal contains higher ash (7.4%)and P (0.9%) than that in okara (4.3% and 0.9%, respectively).6.6 | Metabolizable energyFor ruminants, the energy value of total mixed ration is to be rangedfrom 8.2 to 11.9 MJ/kg of DM for metabolizable energy (ME) (VanEs, 1978). Okara contains reasonably high ME contents with values of14.2 (Hermann & Honeyman, 2004), 11.2 (Dong et al., 2005), 12.3(Diaz-Vargas et al., 2016), and 14.2 (Sinha et al., 2013) MJ/kg of DM,which can fulfill the energy requirement for most ruminants. Motaweet al. (2012) reported that okara contains slightly lower ME than thatin soybean meal (9.0 vs. 9.3 MJ/kg of DM, respectively).6.7 | Anti-nutrientsRaw soybean contains anti-nutrients including trypsin inhibitors,phytic acid, saponin, hemagglutinin and isoflavones (Li et al., 2013),but these contents can be reduced by processing methods such assoaking and grinding, which will make the soybean safe to be fed toanimals (Rahman et al., 2020; Stanojevic et al., 2013). These anti-nutrients can be partially inactivated by heat, or eliminated throughthe various steps of the manufacturing process (i.e., soaking, grinding,and filtration) (Friedman & Brandon, 2001). Anti-nutrients in okaracan also be inactivated significantly by fermentation (Mukherjeeet al., 2016; O’Toole, 1999).Rumen microbiota is able to degrade phytic acid, but it isunsuitable for monogastric (pigs and poultry) animals. Thus, emphasison phytic acid is important in feed for nonruminants. The undigestedphytate that ends up in the excrements of the animals will lead to therun-off of P into aquatic ecosystems, which consequently contributesto severe pollution risks (Brinch-Pedersen et al., 2014).There were no detrimental effects on blood metabolite parame-ters and animal health from okara-feeding after summarizing theresults in Tables 5 and 6. However, Nagamine et al. (2015) gives acontrasting report that there are problems in goat kids (problem: goi-ter) and female goats (problems: parturient paresis, premature birthand still birth) after being fed a mixture of okara and hay; neverthe-less, this report does not have much strong evidence as they did notactually conduct an experiment regarding this matter.7 | PRESERVATION FORM AND PROCESSING WAY AFFECTING THE NUTRITIVE VALUES, INTAKE, AND DIGESTIBILITY7.1 | Ensiling formEnisling process alters the chemical composition of okara, which canenhance its palatability, flavor, and nutritive values, especially in thecase of polysaccharides, lactic acid and amino acid (Giang et al., 2012;Li et al., 2016; Mok et al., 2019; Quintana et al., 2017). Due to thesubtle flavor and savory taste of okara, it can increase the palatabilityof the feed. Preservation form and processing way of okara affectingits nutritive values and animal performances are shown in Figure 1.Ensiling process can acidify the okara materials by the action of anaer-obic microorganisms, and thus extend its shelf life. During the fermen-tation process, microorganisms degrade the fiber partially to formvolatile fatty acids, such as lactic, acetic and butyric acids (Caoet al., 2009). Moreover, microbial fermentation can reduce toxicity ofsome anti-nutritional factors including trypsin inhibitors (Mukherjeeet al., 2016); this can produce beneficial metabolites includingT A B L E 4 Mineral composition (mg/100 g on a dry matter basis) of okara (Vong & Liu, 2016)Minerals ContentPotassium 936–1,350Sodium 16–96Calcium 260–428Magnesium 130–165Iron 0.6–11Copper 0.1–1.2Manganese 0.2–3.1Zinc 0.3–3.5RAHMAN ET AL. 5 of 16T A B L E 5 Performance of ruminants fed okara as affected by different species and dietary treatmentsSpecies Treatment Preservation form and processing way Results ReferencesCow/steer Diet including okara Corn grain ensiled with 30% okara, which was added into diet at 20.88%.

(2019) also found a positive result whichshowed that fermented okara had a prebiotic function and couldincrease short chain fatty acids.The nutritive value of okara can be increased by fermentationusing specific yeasts or microorganisms. For example, Rashadet al. (2011) observed that antioxidant activities of okara wereincreased by solid yeast fermentation. Fermented okara usingBacillus subtilis can enhance cellulase and xylanase enzymes (Moket al., 2019), whereas, using Lactobacillus plantarum can enhance theunsaturated and saturated fatty acids ratio (Quintana et al., 2017).Sitanggang et al. (2020) also reported that fermentation of okara usingR. oligosporus or A. oryzae could improve its antioxidant activity, pro-tein content and protein digestibility. Total phenolic compounds andtotal amino acids of fermented okara can be increased 4 and 20 timeshigher than the unfermented okara, respectively (Shi et al., 2013),when okara was fermented by G. lucidum. Ensiling process improvespeptide bond cleavage resulting in more free amino acids, therebyincreasing the protein digestibility (O’Toole, 1999).Wang and Nishino (2008) observed a low level of lactic acid pro-duction (0.22%) when okara was ensiled alone, which indicates thatokara is better preserved when ensiled with other feed ingredients.Yang (2005) reported that okara ensiled with peanut hulls (78:22)after 8 weeks of fermentation had a beneficial effect on both in-vitroruminal fermentation and ideal silage characteristics due to decreaseof fiber content and lignification. Okara ensiled with 15% beet pulpshowed good silage characteristics such as low pH and high lactic acidcontent (Harjanti et al., 2012).Although the inclusion of okara (fresh or dry) in diets showedhigher intake and digestibility than those without okara (Rahmanet al., 2015, 2016; Rostagno et al., 2011; Thakur et al., 2015), thereare still limited data on how the ensiled okara influences these param-eters. We inferred that ensiled okara can improve the intake anddigestibility because of the presence of readily available free aminoacids, small peptide and low content of anti-nutritional factorsresulted by microbial fermentation.7.2 | Dry formFresh okara can be dried at ambient temperature or using an oven.The nutritional values of okara may not be increased by drying pro-cess, unlike ensiling process; however, both processes can extend itsshelf life. As expected, total viable bacteria, yeasts and molds countsof wet Okara were significantly higher than dried Okara (Senguptaet al., 2012).The digestibility of crude protein, amino acids and lipids in okarais higher than that of soybean (Rostagno et al., 2011). They reportedthat digestibility of CP in okara was higher (99.6%) than that of soy-bean meal (91.0%).

Overfeeding okara coulddecrease feed intake and performance of nonruminants due to thehigh fiber content (Motawe et al., 2012). Dried okara can be includedup to 10% in broiler diet without any adverse effects on performance,carcass yield, or blood parameters (Diaz-Vargas et al., 2016).Just like ensiling form, dry form has the ability to increase okara’sshelf life, and digestibility of crude protein and lipids. Unlike completesoya diets, dry okara replacement does not have adverse effects onfeed intake, mortality and weight gain. Despite of these benefits,ensiling form has an upper hand as dry form does not show a promi-nent increase in nutritional values. Besides, fibers remain in the dryokara, decreasing feed intake and performance of nonruminants, dueto lack of breakdown of the fibers by microorganisms normally seen inensiling form. Although transporting cost of dry okara is consideredcheap, its drying process comes with an additional cost.8 | ANIMAL PERFORMANCESAnimals that were fed an okara-inclusive diet showed similar or higherfeed intake than those fed diets excluding okara (Tables 5 and 6).Since okara has fine taste, high energy, protein and other nutrients,adding it in diets will make it attractive for animal feeding, with theaim of replacing part or all of their concentrates. Furthermore, inclu-sion of okara in the diet can also increase the palatability and feedintake of animals, which can result in increase of the body weight gainin the animals. High crude fat content in okara also contributes to theincrease of the body weight gain and feed intake of the animals.8.1 | RuminantsOkara contains a significant amount of insoluble fiber, which can befermented efficiently by microbes in the rumen. Previous studies haveproved the ability of dietary okara in enhancing the performance inruminants (Table 5). It shows that not only can okara be used toreplace soybean meal (partially or completely) in ruminant diets, butalso can replace concentrate feed completely. Due to high protein andenergy, okara can be used in a total mixed ration, or alongside foragefor feeding.8.1.1 | DairyBased on most published works, there was no adverse effect ofdietary okara on milk production in dairy cows. Thakur et al. (2015)observed that supplementation of okara can enhance milkproduction, as animals have a higher DM intake and digestibilitywhen supplemented with higher levels of okara. In addition, nodifferences (due to okara-feeding) were observed in fat-correctedmilk, milk fat, milk solids-not-fat and milk total solids. In anotherstudy, Tres, Jobim, Rossi, et al. (2020) observed that okara-inclusivediet increased nutrient digestibility despite of decreased DM intake,maintaining the same milk production and composition, comparedto the control diet, indicating its high digestibility. Wanget al. (2003) reported that Holstein Friesian cows maintained similarnutrient intake, milk yield and milk fat percent when okara replaced50% soybean in their diet. Similar results are also observed in dairycows (in relation to the DM intake, milk yield, milk compositionand blood metabolites) when okara replaced soybean meal up to30% and full fat soya in their concentrate mixture as reported byThakur et al. (2015). Lactating dairy cows fed diet containing okarashowed similar results (in terms of DM intake, milk yield, yield ofmilk fat and true protein, and plasma concentrations of methionine,lysine and histidine) with those fed diet containing soybean meal(Santana et al., 2016). They also observed that concentrations ofmilk true protein, milk urea nitrogen and plasma urea nitrogen werehigher in cows fed okara-inclusive diet than those fed soybean-inclusive diet. Holstein steers fed okara ensiled with corn grainshowed higher digestibility of nonfiber carbohydrates and etherextract, and better degradability of soluble fraction, DM, and CPcompared to control-diet (Tres, Jobim, Diaz, et al., 2020). Based onabove findings, we inferred that the inclusion of okara in dairycow’s diet can be considered a viable alternative to replacesoybean and soybean meal.8.1.2 | BeefOkara has been widely fed to beef cattle. For example,Kim et al. (2012) observed that Hanwoo steers fed dietscontaining 25 and 35% okara showed higher DM intake (7.99 and8.11 kg/day, respectively), carcass weight and crude fat content ofmeat than those fed diets without okara (7.71 kg/d); however,it did not increase the quality grade of the meat. Yasudaet al. (2016) assessed the feeding effect of dietary okara on thebeef quality of Japanese black steer, and they found that thosefed with diet containing okara (15.7%) and soy sauce cake (5.2%)did not show any adverse effect on the growth performance,ruminal fermentation, carcass traits and fatty acid composition inmeat (except for C16:1). However, in their study, steers fed okarashowed higher total cholesterol and phospholipid contents in bloodthan those fed nonokara based diet, whereas, in physiochemicalcharacteristics, meat samples from steers fed okara showed lowerredness color of beef (a*) and chroma values than those fromnonokara based diet. The above findings suggest that okara can beconsidered a suitable feed for beef cattle, since it leads to benefitsin feed intake, growth rate and intramuscular fatty acidcomposition of meat.10 of 16 RAHMAN ET AL.8.1.3 | Goats and sheepThere have recently been a number of studies evaluating okara as afeed for small ruminants. Several benefits are seen when okara isincluded in the small ruminant’s diet, especially on performance andquality of products. Nagamine et al. (2015) reported that goats fedokara silage showed better feed conversion ratio (FCR), growth andmeat production than those fed nonokara based diet. They alsoobserved that the digestibility of DM, CP, crude fat, CF and nitrogenfree extract for okara feeding in goats were 79.3%, 79.9%, 92.0%,65.5%, and 90.3%, respectively. In another study, Rahmanet al. (2015) observed that goats that were fed fresh okara and Napiergrass ad libitum showed high okara intake (3.0% of their body weight,DM basis), followed by observation of diarrhea signs possibly due toits high moisture. This experiment indicates both the importance andlimitation of okara in the diets of animals (Ishida, 2002). However,nutrient intake and digestibility of adult goats were enhanced whenthey were fed diets increasing levels (up to 2.0% DM of body weight)of okara as reported by Rahman et al. (2015). In another study,Rahman et al. (2020) reported that goats fed with diets consisting dif-ferent levels of okara showed similar DM, organic matter and CP oreven higher NDF digestibility than those fed diets excluding okara. Incontrast, Harthan and Cherney (2017) reported that no significanteffect of feeding okara on weight gain of lambs or milk composition ofewes was observed. Improvement in weight gain of the animals couldbe observed due to okara’s taste, high nutritive values, intake anddigestibility.Feeding okara may not depress the reproductive performance ofanimals, since the use of this by-product did not depress the digest-ibility, growth and milk production as observed by numerous studies(Harthan & Cherney, 2017; Rahman et al., 2015; Rahman et al., 2020).Feeding okara up to 2.0% DM of body weight did not harm the repro-ductive performance of goats (Rahman et al., 2015). Since there is lim-ited data about the feeding effects of okara in reproduction ofanimals, there might be no conclusive statement as research isrequired in this regard.8.2 | NonruminantsThe results shown in Table 6 suggested that animals fed with anokara-inclusive diet showed similar or higher weight gain than thosefed with diets exclusive of okara. Soybean meal or other proteinsources can be replaced partially with okara in nonruminant diets, andthe amount of replacement can vary depending on the species ofanimals.8.2.1 | PigsPigs fed fermented okara showed higher daily gain (0.75vs. 0.69 kg/d) and FCR (2.89 vs. 3.06) than those fed control diet(Tian et al., 2020). They also observed an enhanced quality (meat colorand antioxidant capacity) in their meat by increasing polysaccharidesand intramuscular fat deposition. Increase in fat content of okara-inclusive diets may have a positive effect on high-quality meat yield,since intramuscular fat plays a vital role in meat qualities, such as fla-vor, texture, tenderness, water-holding capacity and juiciness. Inanother study, Hermann and Honeyman (2004) observed that pigswhose diet included okara up to 25% did not show any adverse effecton body weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion.8.2.2 | PoultryGrowth performance of broiler chicken was not affected by feedingthem diets where soybean meal was replaced with okara up to 75%,and the FCR (1.83–1.88) of the okara-fed group was not significantly(p > 0.05) different from the control group (Motawe et al., 2012).Diaz-Vargas et al. (2016) also reported that broiler chicken fed withdiets containing okara up to 10% did not show any detrimental effectson their growth performance and FCR (1.79–1.86). In another study,there were no differences in carcass yield when broiler chickens werefed diets with various levels of okara (El-Nagmy et al., 2004;Ibrahim, 2006). Okara can replace about 60% of the soybean meal ingrowing duck’s diet without any change in performance (Donget al., 2005). Similarly, Diaz-Vargas et al. (2016) reported that broilerchicken (from 1 to 21 days of age) fed diets containing okara up to10% showed no adverse effects on performance, carcass yield orblood metabolic profiles.In contrast, Motawe et al. (2012) observed that broiler chickenfed okara based diet (replacement of soybean meal by okara at 25%,50%, and 75%) showed lower feed intake than those fed nonokara-based diet, and full replacement (100%) of soybean meal by okara indiets had an adverse effect on carcass yield, which might haveresulted due to the effect of high CF content in okara. However, nodifference was observed in their digestibility of DM, organic matter orCP between okara-based diets (diets containing 25%, 50%, and 75%okara) and nonokara based diet. Tarachai et al. (1999) recommendedincluding okara into laying hens diet strictly only up to 10% as increas-ing the percentage of okara in the diet may cause adverse effects suchas lower egg production. Although some favorable results in pigs andpoultry are given, it is difficult to accept that a feed with high levels offiber can be included in their diets without affecting their productivity,so information about the control diet and the feed ingredientsreplacing the okara in the diet should be taken for consideration.8.2.3 | Other nonruminantsFish nutritionists have made several works on partially/completelyreplacing fish meal with cheap locally available protein sources toavoid the dependency on fish meal as a single protein source for aquafeeding. Okara can safely be used in aquaculture feeds in high levelssince its anti-nutrients are reduced using biological treatments, suchas manufacturing process and fermentation (Aya, 2017). AfricanRAHMAN ET AL. 11 of 16catfish fed with diets containing 50% fermented okara showed lowerFCR (1.01) than those fed with other experimental diets (1.22–2.19)(Zulhisyam et al., 2020). In contrast, Tilapia fish (Oreochromis sp.) fedwith okara showed no difference (p > 0.05) on the growth perfor-mance and feed utilization efficiency when compared over feeding offishmeal pellet (Mohamad, 2015). Since there is still limited data ondigestibility, suitability of aqua feeds and economic analysis of okarafeeding in aquatic animals, more research regarding this matter isneeded to evaluate the viability and profitability of this by-product inaquaculture feeds.Overall, use of okara as feed is proposed in substitution of soy-bean meal by several researchers (Dong et al., 2005; Rahmanet al., 2020; Thakur et al., 2015). The composition in the ingredients,for example, protein, fat and fiber, however, are extremely different.9 | COST AND BENEFITSThe price of okara is relatively low, although handling and transportcost is high due to labor and the time taken to transport it. Farmers inMalaysia pay about US$50 per metric ton for raw okara, including thedelivery cost from the factory to the farm (personal communication).Okara can be an alternative animal feed to soybean meal which wouldhelp to reduce the demand and cost of soybean meal. Besides, it canminimise the environmental problems of the improper disposal ofokara. In places where there is accessibility of okara, it should beincluded as a concentrate supplement or as a substitution for 100%soybean meal in the diets of goats (Rahman et al., 2016; Rahmanet al., 2020) so as to properly utilize this inexpensive by-productinstead of dumping it. Wang et al. (2004) observed that animals fedwith okara-inclusive diets showed significantly lower feeding costcompared to those fed diets consisting of soybean. In animal feeding,there is, undoubtedly, immense potential in utilizing okara as areplacement for soybean meal and other conventional proteinsources, as not only does it effectively utilize okara but also reducesthe feeding cost of animals.It appears that okara, if dried or mixed wet with other ingredients(regularly), has good nutrient availability, and when fed to ruminantswith diets prepared daily using wet okara as part of a supplement canmarkedly reduce feed cost and the cost of gain. However, preserva-tion form and processing way of okara, ensiling and drying, generateadditional costs. For sun-drying method, it requires concrete floor orplastic sheets to spread the okara and dry on it, but this method needsfavorable weather and more labor to handle it. During drying okarausing oven, one of the most important factors to be considered is theprotein quality, which can be affected by the drying temperature.Grizotto and de Aguirre (2011) stated that the drying of okara in adrum drier is suitable in which the physicochemical composition ofokara is not changed. The shelf life of the dried okara can be increasedsignificantly by heating (45C–50C) in a dryer for long hour so thatnutritional quality of the final product is not affected. Drying okarausing dryer, however, appeared either costly or were not beneficial interms of product quality. Hence, alternative drying method for okarathat may result in making economically viable and better quality finalproduct need to be investigated.Besides that, in silage making process, the okara’s right moisturecontent can be deducted up to 75% using sunlight or by adding low-moisture containing feeds, and then it is stored in a silo (plastic bag,plastic drum, well, bunker or ditch) in order to make it air-tight for atleast 21 days; it is used based on requirement and remaining materialis covered back. The ensiling cost for okara is expected to be the sameas the cost of normal silage (can be made from forages, crop residueor industrial by-products). Since trucking cost of silage is high if trans-ported from long distance, ensiled okara must be produced nearby thefeeding place. A major benefit of making silage is that the okara canbe ensiled in almost any weather condition and can also be done in amuch shorter timeframe compared to drying process. Therefore, inorder to avoid the high energy costs of drying, ensiling is a practicaland effective way to store the okara longer.10 | CONCLUSIONSThis review evaluated the nutritional and anti-nutritional values ofokara and its effect on animal performance in terms of feed intake,digestibility, growth, milk production, reproduction and meat quality.Fermentation of okara using specific microorganisms can enhance itsnutritive values. Numerous studies have been carried out on theeffect of okara feeding and found it as cost-effective and an alterna-tive source of protein and energy for specific types of animals. Theoptimum inclusion levels for okara in the diets for various animal spe-cies were identified in this review. Ensiling okara helps to conserve iteven longer, although it is difficult to handle and transport it (whenturned into silage) due to its high moisture and sticky nature.11 | FUTURE PROSPECTIVE RESEARCHESAlthough considerable progress has been made in recent years, moreresearch is needed to be done before being fully able to exploit thisby-product. Finding the answers to the following questions will helpto exploit this by-product:a. Is it possible to enhance microbial growth during fermentation ofokara by addition of additives?b. What are the bacteria that are involved in the stability of okarasilage?c. What are the suitable drying methods for high-moisture containingokara?d. How do we develop an inexpensive and highly efficient dryer forokara?e. What are the feeding effects of okara on animal’s physiologicalhealth and reproduction?More researches are also needed on the matter of whetherincluding okara in the diet of aqua life is beneficial and economical.12 of 16 RAHMAN ET AL.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe authors would like to thank Universiti Malaysia Kelantan forfinancial support to conduct this research under the internal researchgrant (R/C19/A0700/0157A/002/2020/00776).
