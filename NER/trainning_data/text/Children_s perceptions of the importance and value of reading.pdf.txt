Regularrecreational reading is associated with both literacy skill acquisition and maintenance acrossthe lifespan. Children’s perceptions of the importance and value of reading can influencetheir motivation to read. However, it is not currently known if children continue to perceivethe value of reading beyond the period of independent reading skill acquisition. Findingsfrom a sample of 997 older elementary children indicate that some children may notrecognise the value of reading beyond independent reading skill acquisition. This isparticularly significant, as children who valued the practice of reading read with greaterfrequency. In addition, children’s subjective task valuing of reading was revealed through thescope of benefits they associated with engagement in the practice, which influenced theirconceptualisation of its value.  These findings have implications for future educationalreading interventions, as fostering greater valuing of regular reading may enhance children’sreading engagement, with valuing of reading found to be an important component ofchildren’s reading motivation.We may perhaps take for granted that the importance of reading is well-understood bychildren, given the position of reading as a fundamental literacy skill, the regular practice ofwhich is strongly associated with a range of literacy advantages (e.g. OECD, 2010a; Samuels& Wu, 2001). When determining how to effectively engage children in regular reading, inaddition to consideration of fostering reading skill, the fostering of reading will is also of2great significance. The fostering of will has particular relevance beyond the period ofindependent reading skill acquisition, which may vary significantly between individuals, buttypically occurs during the early years of elementary schooling. As children advance throughthe schooling years, their engagement in regular reading for pleasure declines (Maynard,Mackay & Smyth, 2008; OECD, 2010b; Sainsbury & Schagen, 2004; Scholastic, 2015). Tosupport the fostering of reading will, and motivation to read, consideration must be given tothe reasons why children choose to engage in the practice. This involves, but is not limited to,maintaining a current and comprehensive understanding of children’s beliefs about theimportance of reading, which can exert a significant influence on their level of engagement inthe practice.Regular engagement in recreational reading offers benefits for literacy skill development andmaintenance. While regular independent reading has long been associated with literacy skillbenefits across a range of literacy outcomes (e.g. Anderson, Wilson & Fielding, 1988;Cunningham & Stanovich, 2001; OECD, 2010a), research increasingly points to the role thatregular reading plays in both maintaining and extending literacy skills. Research intoSummer Literacy Decline (e.g. Cooper et al., 1996) shows a cumulative impact over the yearsof periods of limited exposure to reading (Krashen & Shin, 2008). This has been related toeffects upon vocabulary (Lawrence et al., 2015), spelling (Cooper et al., 1996) andcomprehension (Guryan, 2015). As such, literacy advocates and educators are encouraged toincreasingly position reading as of both immediate and continuing importance beyondindependent skill acquisition. Indeed, the growing body of findings relating readingfrequency with cognitive stamina and resistance to cognitive decline (e.g. Vermuri &Mormino 2013; Wilson et al. 2013) highlights the importance of continuing to read intoadulthood.3Perception of the importance of reading may be related to children’s subjective task values inrelation to reading, which include “interest value, defined as how much the individual likes oris interested in the activity; attainment value, defined as the importance of the activity; andutility value, or the usefulness of an activity” (Wigfield, 1997, pp. 60-61).  Individuals’choice, persistence, and performance can be explained by their beliefs about how well theywill perform the activity, and the extent to which they value the activity, suggesting thatalong with expectancies for success, children’s ability beliefs and their subjective task valuescan shape their “choice, persistence and performance” of activities, as well as influence “theextent to which they value the activity” (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000, p. 68). Task valuing hasbeen found to contribute to motivation across a range of academic subjects and contexts (e.g.Ball et al., 2016; Guo, Parker, Marsh & Morin, 2015).With task value positioned as a significant determinant of both motivation and taskengagement (Gambrell, Palmer, Codling & Mazzoni, 1996), the work reported in this articleassumes a relationship between a person’s perceived value of a practice, their ability toperform the practice, and their willingness to engage in it. This involves understandingchildren’s perceptions and beliefs about their reason to perform the task, as relates to its value(Barron & Hulleman, 2015). This impetus is also aligned with a more practical andimmediate purpose, seeking to determine if children in fact perceive the benefits of reading,as if this is not the case, educational intervention may be indicated.This concern was stimulated by earlier research with adolescents, which found that in somecases, the continued importance of reading beyond the period of skill acquisition was noteffectively communicated by parents, leading to “expired expectations”. Expired expectations4can be conceptualised as the assumption that the practice of reading is no longer important,where parental encouragement is perceived to be withdrawn based on perceived skillacquisition (Merga, 2014). Such withdrawal has also been noted elsewhere, with parentalencouragement and support curtailed in secondary school, perhaps as “they no longer feelthat the skill is required” (Nieuwenhuizen, 2001, p. 6) as skill acquisition has been achieved.It was considered valuable to explore what is occurring in the space between the early yearsof schooling, and the later elementary/primary years, where the skill to read independentlyhas usually been acquired, and the transition from learning to read, to reading to learn, hasoccurred. This research was also designed to garner insights into how children who felt thatreading is important, perceive the scope of benefits of being a good reader.  As such, thisresearch sought to determine if the benefits of reading are successfully being communicatedto children, so that they value the practice, or if this is an orphaned responsibility, ascontended elsewhere (Merga, 2016; Bunbury, 1995). The notion of orphaned responsibilityrelates to where “parents may assume it is the role of the teachers and teachers may assume itis the role of the parents to provide continued encouragement in reading” (Merga & MatRoni, 2018, p. 4).The previous research in this area has been predominately qualitative (e.g. Merga, 2015;Strommen & Mates, 2004). While this has provided deep insight into children’s attitudestoward reading, the factors that can shape these attitudes, and the mechanisms by whichexpired expectations can be inadvertently communicated, it precludes generalisability. It hasalso generally been explored as part of a broader research concern and not given singularattention.5Drawing on a sample of older elementary (primary school) students in Western Australia,who took part in the 2016 Western Australian Study in Children’s Book Reading (WASCBR),this article seeks to address the following three key research questions:1. Do children perceive reading as important beyond skill acquisition?2. Is perception of reading importance beyond skill acquisition associated with readingfrequency?3. How is the importance of being a good reader understood and conceptualised by children?MethodSites and participantsAfter “purposeful sampling” to ensure representative diversity was achieved (Anfara, Brown& Mangoine, 2002, p. 30), the final data set included 24 co-educational schools from diversegeographical locations and contexts. We do not provide further details about the schools toavoid deductive disclosure, as we are bound by ethics to preserve the anonymity of theparticipating schools.Table 1.

Theaverage Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage (ICSEA) value for the schoolsthat participated in the student survey sample (mean ICSEA=1040.9) was close to the ICSEAaverage, which is set at 1000. The ICSEA is based on student factors (parents’ occupation,parents’ education) as well as school factors (geographical location, proportion of Indigenousstudents), whereby “the higher the ICSEA value, the higher the level of educationaladvantage of students who go to this school” (Australian Curriculum, Assessment andReporting Authority (ACARA), 2015).Participants in the WASCBR were children at Western Australian primary schools in Years 4and 6 (aged 8-12). While all children in these year groups were invited to participate, onlystudents who were present on the day of data collection and who had provided both theirconsent and the consent of a guardian could participate in the study. All consenting andpresent students (n=997) completed the survey on site on the day they were visited by theresearcher, with visits occurring between March the 23rd and June the 21st 2016. In addition,one of the students who had participated in the survey was randomly selected from each classfor an interview, with the selection being controlled so that one male and one female studentwere interviewed per school where possible. Some limitations to this method occurred in thefield as in one school only one Year 4 student was available for the interview. This resulted in47 interviews being conducted.Details of survey respondents are shown in Table 2.Table 2.

The tools were then subject to minor revision. The data8derived from this pilot were not included in the final data set. While these tools sought toaddress a range of research concerns within the field of reading research, this article reportson the items relevant to the aforementioned research questions based on responses to thestudent survey and interviews.The research questions “Do children perceive reading as important beyond skill acquisition?’and ‘Is perception of reading importance beyond skill acquisition associated with readingfrequency?’ are addressed as quantitative items in response to best-fit principles, as they arereliant on the larger sample to allow for some limited capacity for generalizability.  Datapertaining to these research questions were captured in the survey question “Once you knowhow to read, do you still need to read?”In order to investigate the research question “How is the importance of being a good readerunderstood and conceptualised by children?”, qualitative data were collected on interviewitems in response to focussed questions, enabling breadth of scope and greater child influenceof the findings generated. To examine children’s conceptualisation of the value of being aproficient reader, they were asked, “Is it important to be a good reader?”, and prompted with,“Why/why not?” if required, as part of the semi-structured interview schedule. This questionplaces the emphasis on the importance of the skill, being a good reader, rather than simply onthe practice of reading.AnalysisIn order to investigate the research question “Do children perceive reading as important beyondskill acquisition?”, basic analysis was performed on the quantitative data, generating means,9range, mode and standard deviation as relevant to the research question, to test the hypothesisemerging from previous research in this area, that not all children perceive the importance ofreading beyond the period of skill acquisition. Data were subject to cross-tabulation within thesurvey platform using filtering mechanisms to examine the presence of general trends relatingto year group, age and gender, in relation to the responses. Mann-Whitney U tests (Mann &Whitney, 1947) were performed to investigate gender effects regarding the children’sperception of continuing reading beyond the skill acquisition. Three Spearman’s rho tests(Spearman, 1904) were also conducted to examine the correlation between age and theimportance of reading, overall, and these tests were controlled for gender.A Spearman’s rho test was also conducted to scrutinise for potential correlation betweenreading frequency in general and the reported view on the importance of reading after the skillhad been acquired.  In this way, it was investigated if the perception of importance of readingwas in fact statistically correlated with reading frequency, hence exploring the potentialinfluence that the perception of importance could have on the children’s reading habits.Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also run on the dataset to determine if thereading frequency was consistent (homogeneous) among all three different children cohortswho were different in their view of the importance of reading. This analysis requires the totalsample to be split into three sub-samples. These are those responded “Yes” (it is important, n= 882), “No” (it is not important, n = 32), and “Not sure” (n = 137). Subsequent to the result,post-hoc pairwise analysis using was made using Mann-Whitney U tests to determine whichcohort(s) were statistically different.10In order to investigate the research question “How is the importance of being a good readerunderstood and conceptualised by children?”, interview data were collected and transcribedwith an iterative coding technique being applied. Constant comparative analysis (Boeije,2002; Kolb, 2012) was used as “an analytical process in which incoming data is comparedwith existing data in the process of coding and category development” (Birks & Mills, 2015,p. 177) to “discern conceptual similarities, to refine the discriminative power of categories,and to discover patterns” (Tesch, 1990) in relation to the research questions.  An emic focusto analysis was adopted so that the participants’ viewpoints were foregrounded (Schutt,2012). In this way, children’s ideas and perspectives could generate the findings with an openmind being maintained during analysis to enable codes to emerge from the data. The codes,then, could locate around authentic themes, bringing the literature to bear primarily in thepost-coding phase to avoid seeking to confirm existing findings.  This analysis sought tocapture the breadth of each area under the importance of being a good reader section in themapping of overall scope, (see Figure 1). Interview responses used in the result section arepresented in a lightly edited verbatim form with meaning being unadulterated.ResultsReading beyond skill acquisitionAs can be seen in Table 4 below, 82.9% of respondents agreed that reading s important afterskill acquisition. This finding was consistent in both genders as indicated by results of theMann-Whitney U test, where no statistical significant differences were found between thesegroups (Girls: Mean Rank = 498.77, n = 561, Boys: Mean Rank = 490.06, n = 428) in theirrating towards post skill-acquisition reading, U = 117,939.00, z = -.727, p = .471.Table 4.

Although significant, the coefficient, rs, suggested a weak correlation betweenage and the perceived importance of reading. Thus, two separate Spearman rho tests (withBonferroni adjusted α of .025) were later run for boys and girls. The correlations were foundto be positive and statistically significant for boys but not for girls. These results aresummarised in Table 5.Table 5.

Relative to the totalsample (N = 997) in Table 2, boys showed only a slightly greater inclination than girls to fallinto the negative/unsure category with boys at 43.1% of the whole sample, but 45.6% of thenegative/unsure subset. The mean age of negative/unsure respondents was also marginallyyounger, at 9.67, compared with 9.83 in the whole sample.However, filtering this set further into the small subset of n = 32 of children who respondedin the negative yielded a mean age of 10.06, slightly higher than the whole group average.The Mann-Whitney U test shows no significant difference between boys and girls in thisinstance.(Insert Figure 1. Children’s self-reported reading frequency in relation to their perception ofreading importance beyond skill acquisition)13As per Figure 1, children who agreed that reading was still important after skill acquisitionwere more likely to report daily reading (40.5%) than children who disagreed or were unsure(23.1%). In contrast, children who disagreed or were unsure were more likely to read onlysometimes or never (47.9%) than children who agreed (28.6%). This was supported bySpearman’s rho test which showed a positive significant correlation between perception ofthe importance of reading after skill acquisition and reading frequency in general, rs = .182, p< .001, two-tailed, N = 991.Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was later performed on the dataset toinvestigate if the children’s reading frequency in general was different between the threepossible agreement groups, namely those children who agreed, children who were not sure, orchildren who disagreed that reading remained important beyond independent reading skillacquisition. The result showed that there were statistically significant differences between thechildren who disagreed (Mean Rank = 280.72), were not sure (Mean Rank = 416.08), andthose who agreed (Mean Rank = 517.70), H = .263, df = 2, p < .001.Within-group differences were subsequently investigated to see which, if any, of these threeagreement groups (disagree/not sure/agree) were different in their assessment on theimportance of continuing reading after reading skill had been acquired. These follow-uppairwise comparisons using the Mann-Whitney U test (with Bonferroni adjusted α of .017)indicated that reading frequency in general was statistically different among the three groupsholding varying attitudes toward the importance of reading beyond independent reading skillacquisition (disagree/not sure/agree). The results suggested heterogeneous groups, with thehighest reading frequency was found to be among the children who agreed about theimportance of reading beyond the skill acquisition, Mean Rank = 435.90, U = 6,916.50, z = -144.833, p < .001, compared to the groups who responded with not sure and disagree (No) Thispair-wise post-hoc analysis is summarised in Table 7.Table 7.

As perFigure 2 below, responses concerned both the future and the present, though some children(categorised as unimportant supported, and explained herein) were ambivalent about theimportance of being a good reader.(Insert Figure 2. Scope of importance of being a good reader)Future functional. Reading is seen as useful for functioning in future life, as separate fromacademic, vocational and social needs. Children felt that it was important to be a good reader,as it is necessary for reading instructions, and to facilitate effective communication andreading comprehension, with Samuel explaining “’cos if you can’t read complicated15sentences, then it’s hard to understand people right”. Similarly, Lucian, who struggled withreading, felt that low literacy could lead to him getting lost when he learned to drive,explaining a scenario where “there’s two streets starting with L and you say I’ve got to turnon one that starts with L”; inability to read the whole word could lead to choosing the wrongstreet, and then “you're going to lose yourself (sic)”. As such, being a good reader isconceptualised by Lucian at an elementary skill level, with the reading of street signs not ahigh-literacy skill task. This relatively basic conceptualisation of reading may be reflective ofLucian’s self-concept and skill in reading, as he was not confident in his reading ability.Therefore, it is possible that his concept of good reading may thus be at a lower skill levelthan good reading for a high-achieving and confident reader.Future vocational. The value of being a good reader could be imagined as part of a requiredvocational skill set. For these children, as for the other children with exclusively futuristicattributions for reading importance, literacy needs are situated far beyond the immediate, withthe need for literacy skills future oriented. While often vocation-specific, these projectionscan also be quite vague and ambivalent in their vision, with children contending that readingis important “so you can read when you are an adult” or that it is “probably good for thefuture”. Reading is positioned as conferring benefits for job interviews, signing employmentcontracts, and for successfully fulfilling imagined future work roles. In addition to vocationalperformance and initial employability, it also dictated scope of vocational choices, asexplained by Briana:…it kind of depends on your later life, when you’re an adult, ‘cos if you want certainjobs, like a teacher for instance, you have to probably read out loud to your childrenthat you’re teaching. And you have to be able to pronounce words, most of the time.16And if you want to be a doctor, you have to be able to read the different body parts, tolearn how to be a doctor.It is also important to note Briana’s initial qualification that the necessity to be a proficientreader was dependent on vocational requirements, and as such, is not unequivocallyimportant. In a similar vein, David described how literacy would be involved as part ofcontingency measures, should his preferred job be unattainable:Interviewer:  And do you think it’s important to be a good reader?Respondent: Yes.Interviewer:  Why do you say that?Respondent: Because if you go to uni you're going to need to know how to readto actually get a job.Interviewer:  Do you want to go to uni when you grow up?Respondent: I might have to if I don’t get the job I want.Interviewer:  What job do you want?Respondent: To be an AFL player.As such, literacy improvement does not necessarily align with David’s future vocationalrequirements. It is not necessarily a privileged skill highlighted as crucial for success in therole that is his first preference, namely playing Australian Rules football (being an “AFLplayer”).Parents could play a role in encouraging their children to adopt a vocational perspective aboutreading. For example, Josh’s father urged the importance of literacy, as “Dad says I’ll need toread later on, if I want to know what to sign in the NBA contract”.17Future academic. Though not seen as an immediate academic advantage, some childrenprojected the benefits of reading into the future. Tyler recognised the academic importance ofliteracy achievement for the future, explaining:I guess if you weren’t a good reader and you had no idea what you were looking at,then you wouldn’t know what to do in the future, like if you got an assignment orsomething, and it says to do all this stuff, and you’d be like, ‘What is this? I have noidea what this is’.Zac also described being a good reader as something that “helps you in your studies whenyou grow up”, allowing access to “really hard books” in order to “get good marks and stuff”.He recognised that his reading skills would need to continue to improve, in order to cope withthe growing complexity in texts that he anticipated facing in the future.Immediate academic. Anna saw more immediate benefit, viewing reading as a foundationalliteracy skill, which can support skill development across the breadth of literacy needs. Lucysimilarly understood that reading books is important due to the immediate and continuingliteracy demands of life, explaining “basically everywhere you go, someone will ask you, oryou will be asked to read something. So, I think it’s a really good thing to have, that you canread books.” The general knowledge that can be obtained from reading books was alsorecognised, with Marco explaining “they really teach you a lot”, as “in Year 4 I liked alsorocks and all the minerals, so in the library I’d always go to the non-fiction section and findall of those, and some of the words were really long, as well, so it’s important to be a goodreader so that you can understand”. Tom also appreciated the benefits of reading forvocabulary, as “if you're a good reader you learn all these really good words to use”, and Max18felt that reading was essential for second language acquisition, explaining “because if youcan’t read, you could never really understand a different language, if you wanted to”.Reading was also thought to stimulate intellectual inquiry, and foster intelligence.Immediate social. Children who saw immediate social benefits of reading valued them forincreasing the scope of their exposure to social experience. Karen used purposeful reading todevelop her interpersonal skills and to mitigate risks in her transition from childhood toadolescence:Books give me a lot of really good ideas on how I can do things. And I like to readgirl drama books like, teenage girl drama books and lots of it has to do with dealingwith friends. And that’s helped me with how I treat my friends, and how I would liketo be treated by my friends and stuff. So, I reckon being a good reader one would helpyou academically through education, but it will also help you in (other) ways.Interestingly, Karen’s mother did not approve of the books that Karen preferred to read, as“she just doesn’t like those ones where teenage girls go out and they get drunk, and they haveparties and then they find out what they did”, however Karen felt that reading this content didnot dispose her to adopt these behaviours, explaining, “I don’t even think about thepossibility of me doing that, I just block it out”, and that it actually had a protective effect, as“so that I don’t do that when I’m older, because I know I’m 11 and going to be a teenagersoon, and I’m going to want to start doing that, so I get the idea out of my head so that it canhelp me say no before I get too pressured into it”. As such, Karen’s reading equipped her todeal with both immediate and future social challenges.19Future social. Future social concerns about reading were focussed on intergenerationaltransmission of literacy competence. Fiona related good reading skill to parental competence,explaining:…if you get older, then if you have kids, then they’ll want you to read to them, andthen if you don’t know how to read very well, then they might choose this big thickbook,  and you can’t  read it.This was also a concern for Sophie, who reflected, “if you explain to a younger child, if yourpronunciation’s wrong, then that might affect their saying to others (sic)”. As such, this areawas not only concerned with communicative competence to meet the required parental role, itwas also concerned with avoidance of intergenerational transmission of errors.Immediate affective. Children saw being a good reader as being related to immediateaffective enjoyment and relaxation. Max viewed books as being important for immediateentertainment needs, explaining “if you don’t read books then you might get really bored, andbored is bad”. Luke shared this view, as “people who can’t read can never discover the joy ofreading”. In addition to helping concentration and vocational and academic performance,Kate felt that reading had a soothing effect, as “it also helps you get tired and relaxed if youare stressed”.Unimportant supported. An ambivalent position about the importance of being a goodreader could be rooted in a perception that they would not need to be fully independentreaders, as help would always be available. Kara explained:20It’s not really important, but sometimes it is, because you need to…if you need toread something, like an important note, and you can’t read it, then you don’t knowwhat it’s about, like you can still have some help, sometimes.Clare also saw reading as something that she did not need to have independent mastery of,explaining, “it’s good to have a go, but if you can’t, it is probably best to read with someone,that’s a good reader”. In a sense, these children were the opposite of the future orientedchildren, as their imagination of a period of time where support might be withdrawn, andreading autonomy necessary, was limited. To some extent, being a good reader wasconstructed as being inherent and biologically determined. When asked if it was important tobe a good reader, Diana stated, “not everyone is a good reader, but I don’t think it’s thatimportant that you have to be the perfect reader. ‘Cos some people are, and some peoplearen’t.”DiscussionThis article raises a range of limitations and implications for further research. A range offurther findings can be generated from this study, and have been generated to date (e.g. MatRoni & Merga, 2017; Merga & Mat Roni, 2017a-b; Merga & Mat Roni, 2018; Merga, 2016;Merga, 2017a-c). While all directly relevant data have been reported here, other publishedand to be published findings of this study speak to the findings herein. For instance, theexploration of different interpretations of the will to read would contribute further insightsinto children’s motivation to read. However, for the purposes of this article we wanted tofocus on children’s subjective task valuing in relation to the importance of reading, ratherthan to explore their motivations more broadly, as we feel there has been insufficientattention on this particular area. In addition, while we focussed on attainment value in this21article, we did not seek to imply that it is the most significant or important of subjective taskvalues, though arguably it is one of the most under-researched.In addition, the statistical findings explore association and do not establish causation.However, the present indicative results justify to investigate this area in more depth in futureresearch Findings are also limited by the constraints of self-report, and the nested nature ofthe inquiry, whereby the research questions were explored amongst a broader suite ofquestions, though considerable care was taken to avoiding satisficing, particularly by valuingchildren’s other, non-reading interests, and listening closely, with positive body language. Aswe have noted elsewhere, “it is very important that research undertaken in this field becarefully designed to avoid children simply satisficing to meet the researchers’ expectations,and that it acknowledge the limitations in factors such as design and sample size” (Merga,2017a, p. 32). As such, we also recognise that the data are not longitudinal and represent theviews of children in one large but distinct geographic region. Finally, the findings presentedin this article warrant further research in this area, with a greater range of questions to morecomprehensively explore children's perceptions of the importance of reading.Reading beyond skill acquisitionReading remains important beyond the period of skill acquisition, however the findingspresented in this article suggest that this may not be adequately communicated to all children,and that low valuing of reading influences reading frequency through low task valuing. Notall children in the study understood that reading is important beyond skill acquisition, withnearly a fifth not agreeing (as per Table 4), suggesting that educators and parents need tobetter understand, value and transmit the benefits of being a lifelong reader. Reading needs tobe more successfully presented as a valuable and enjoyable recreational pursuit, with ongoing22importance beyond independent reading skill acquisition. While children may attributesubjective task values to recreational reading that are not concerned with reading’s“importance”. For example, reading for pleasure, which may fall outside this scope, a lack ofunderstanding about the importance of reading in nearly a fifth of respondents is concerning,and suggestive of a lack of recognition of the task value of reading.  That children whoviewed reading as being important were nearly twice as likely to be daily readers highlightsthe need to effectively translate the benefits of regular engagement in reading, as this couldlead to children have a positive impression of the importance of reading, according to theaforementioned previous body of research in task valuing (e.g. Ball et al., 2016; Guo, Parker,Marsh & Morin, 2015; Wigfield, 1997; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000).Findings also indicated that, in general, students’ views oregarding the importance of readingbeyond the skill acquisition changed with age, which could reflect the development ofcognitive maturity as the children grew older, or a range of other factors. Other factors mayinclude more extended exposure to Australian high-stakes literacy testing, such as NAPLAN,which is administered to all students in Years 3, 5, 7 and 9 (ACARA, 2016b), greateracademic expectations placed on students in later schooling years and increased exposure toschool-based socialization to attribute value to the practice of reading. Nevertheless, it is aweak correlation, suggesting that this age-related change is not the only factor involved instudents’ determination of the value of reading beyond skill acquisition.At the subsamples level, when the gender is factored in, the correlation between age and theimportance of reading is stronger in boys than in girls. This suggests that more needs to bedone to ensure that, from an early age, boys understand the immediate and ongoingimportance of reading. However, no evidence was found to suggest that the perception of the23importance of reading changes amongst girls as they grow older, suggesting that they may bemore effectively socialised to attribute value to the practice of regular reading.The finding that those who value the importance of reading beyond the skill, tended to befrequent readers in general, highlights the persistent link between the subjective task value ofreading and reading engagement, and the importance of communicating the value of readingfrom the early years of schooling and beyond, in school and in the home and broadercommunity.Importance of being a good reader: scopeThe subjective task values identified through this inquiry primarily related to utility value,though some consideration of interest value was also ultimately encompassed within the“importance” inquiry. Subjective task values are crucial, as they are taken into account whenan individual embarks upon an action or task, asking “Are the consequences of the actionimportant enough to me? If the answer is yes, the individual more likely will undertake theaction. If no, then engagement is less likely” (Eccles & Wigfield, 2002, p. 127). Butunderstanding the kinds of valuing ascribed by young people is also essential tounderstanding their motivation. In this instance, perceived importance of being a good readerwas related to future projections (functional, vocational, academic, social); immediateadvantages (academic, social, affective); or not unequivocally valued, typically due to lack ofperception of a time of withdrawn support.An exclusive future focus on the importance of reading had the potential to situate thepractice as potentially of limited importance. While many children understood the futurebenefits of reading, an exclusive futuristic vocational focus that was sometimes dependent onthe failure of a preferred life pathway that did not require strong literacy skills could have24implications for children’s motivation. This type of relevance is also termed immediacy,which can be characterised as related to “physical and/or psychological closeness”, and it hasbeen found to be linked to both student learning and motivation (e.g. Frymier & Schulman,1995). This limited scope/deferred benefit futuristic respondents were also often ambivalentin their discussion of the importance of being a good reader, as for these children, it was notperceived to confer any immediate advantage. Similarly, a future social orientation wasdependent on future adoption of a parental role.In contrast, immediate social orientation was aligned with both current and a more immediatefuture which draws upon the Theory of Mind. Theory of Mind relates to “the capacity toidentify and understand others’ subjective states” (Comer Kidd & Castano, 2013, p. 377),which is used in this instance for personal education:Just as in real life, the worlds of literary fiction are replete with complicatedindividuals whose inner lives are rarely easily discerned but warrant exploration. Theworlds of fiction, though, pose fewer risks than the real world, and they presentopportunities to consider the experiences of others without facing the potentiallythreatening consequences of that engagement (p. 378)Discussion of the immediate social importance exactly reflects this opportunity for learningfrom a safe distance afforded by the reading of fiction. The needs of social competence thatwere desired were felt to be definite and concrete, whereas the more distant vocational needswere often relatively immaterial at the time of the interview, and subject to change.25The children who were not certain of the importance of reading tended to fall readily into anunimportant supported category when pressed to explain their perspective. Such childrencould be categorised as autonomy resistant, as they did not necessarily value autonomousreading skill. In addition, they held  a view of reading which situates the causes of failure orsuccess in reading as not related to individual effort, but rather a “some people are, and somepeople aren’t” approach, which suggests pre-determination, and a lack of recognition of alink between personal agency and effort, and positive outcomes. This relates to controltheory, a type of expectancy-based theory that postulates, “one should expect to succeed tothe extent that one feels in control of one’s successes and failures (i.e. one has an internallocus of control)” (Eccles & Wigfield, 2002, p. 111).  Therefore, in this instance, relativelylow subjective task valuing is accompanied with a lack of an internal locus of control. Thisemerges as an area for potential education intervention; in our efforts to ensure equity, andacceptance of different abilities, we must avoid inadvertently communicating the idea thatreading skills are pre-determined; children must perceive that their efforts are related to theirindividual improvement, and that they must seek to achieve increasing skills for independentliteracy in order to achieve sufficient literacy skills for both immediate and future needs,across functional, vocational, academic, social and affective dimensions.ConclusionA key part of achieving the goal of increased effective communication of the importance ofreading across the life time lies in educators’ awareness and willing intervention. Withprevious findings from the WASCBR study suggesting that not all primary teachers areperceived to be keen reading models (Merga, 2016), and the pressures of high-stakes testingand overloaded curriculum potentially limiting the time that can be spent highlighting the26importance of continued reading for pleasure in the classroom and beyond, these findingsprovide impetus to reassess educational priorities. It cannot be assumed that children viewreading as important, and considering the relationship between this valuing and children’sreading engagement, it is imperative that more is done to foster reading valuing and will.For children to view reading as important, they need to be conversant about its benefits. Thisresearch also suggests that children may have a limited understanding of these benefits. Ofparticular concern were future-oriented students, for whom literacy skills did not align withvocational aspirations, particularly in relation to young boys hoping to become professionalsportspeople, for whom building literacy skills held questionable relevance. Both immediateand future benefits of reading need to be understood and expounded by educators andparents. However, we also recognise that focus on the skill related benefits of reading islikely to be a part of best practice, not best practice in its entirety. Fostering engagement inreading should also strongly focus on enjoyment in reading, and building of self-efficacy inreading, as we have argued elsewhere (e.g. Merga, 2015).ReferencesAnderson, R., Wilson, P., & Fielding, L.
