As one of the most important components of the modern business environment, technological environment and information technology (IT)  influenced the development of many areas of business. The most notable changes are happening in the production of hardware and software, and industrial production, but also in the management where decision  support systems have long been in use. Within the management, IT receives a special role in human resources management. Electronic Human Resource Management (e-HRM) is a concept which involves the  use of Web-based technologies for providing the services regarding the human resource management in the  organization, and to which access have a wider range of organization`s stakeholders starting from the HRM  department, via managers to employees. The aim of this paper is to highlight the importance of the concept of  e-HRM, its most important features, advantages, potential drawbacks, as well as to show the level of usage of e-HRM in Serbia. The methodology of the paper includes theoretical analysis of the available literature and data on e-HRM and empirical analysis of data on the use of e-HRM in organizations in Serbia. The analysis  was conducted on the database of Cranet research in 2015/2016 by using the SPSS software. The authors point out that e-HRM is a kind of innovation that promotes, develops and facilitates the practice of HRM, both  for the department of human resourcesand for managers and employees.    Keywords  E-HRM, information technologies, Cranet, Serbia.        Introduction The last few decades have witnessed the intense and  dynamic development of IT that deals with its  impacts in various human resource jobs, starting  with the way information and communication, and  many daily activities.  The impact of IT development did not bypass  the most of business entities that, thanks to the  application of this technology and its innovative  solutions, forever changed the way of performing  different business activities. One of the areas that  also did not remain "spared" new ways of  performing activities and tasks is the HRM  function  in  organizations.  Thanks  to  the  application of IT today, there is almost no single segment of the scope of operation of this function  in which IT did not find its application and  irreversibly changed the way in which many  activities had been carried out by then. The  activities that mostly ünderwent" changes are the  collection, keeping and updating of employees’  data, then activities in the field of recruitment and  selection of candidates, the manner of employee  training, performance management, etc. Although  the primary motive for the implementation of IT  within the HRM function was to optimize  procedures in carrying out the above activities,  other positive effects such as cost reduction, better  quality  of  services  provided,  productivity  increase, etc., also emerged. It is therefore not   Berber et al.        Electronic Human Resource Management (e-HRM): А New Concept for Digital Age 23 STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT, Vol. 23 (2018), No. 2, pp. 022-032 surprising  that  an  increasing  number  of  organizations use IT solutions within this  function, as well as increasing the complexity of  applications themselves in this field. It is  important to emphasize that the primary task of  this function has not changed. It remains the  same, which is ẗo enable organizations to have an  adequate number and structure of employees that  will be available at the right time and in the right  place at affordable costs and which will be  motivated to achieve the organization's current  and strategic goals" (Ma & Ye, 2015, p. 76).  However, what has changed with the use of IT is  the way this function accomplishes this task. By  digitizing and automating administrative and  transactional activities, it can do so in a more  efficient way. At the same time, the application of  IT within the HRM function enables employees to  devote more time to those activities that create  greater value for organizations, that is, the design  of more effective policies in the HRM field that  contribute to the improvement of organizational  performance by which it (HRM) becomes the real  strategic partner in business (Parry & Tyson,  2011). Basically, it can be said that the application  of IT within the HRN is dual. First of all, this  technology is used to connect spatially separated  entities by enabling them to interact interactively  with the performance of various HRM activities,  irrespective of whether they are in the same room  or on different continents. Additionally, IT  enables the partial or complete substitution of  human labor in performing various tasks in the  field of HRM, which practically becomes a means  of their execution (Slavić & Berber, 2013, p. 238).  The widespread use of IT in the realization of  HRM activities has influenced the emergence of a  new HRM concept. It is a concept that is known  in academic literature as e-HRM, while in practice  it is more often called e-HR (Foster, 2009). In any  case, this is a concept that implies the use of IT to  provide various services from the human resource  management domain in an organization, and  which approach has a wide range of stakeholders,  starting with HRM department, through managers,  employees, potential  employees,  and  other  stakeholders.  Considering the widespread use of IT for  performing HRM activities, the aim of this paper  is to point out the significance of e-HRM concept,  its most important characteristics, advantages,  potential shortcomings, and to explore the level of  use of e-HRM in Serbia. The paper includes a  theoretical analysis of available literature and data on e-HRM, as well as an analysis of empirical  data on the use of e-HRM in organizations in  Serbia. The analysis was carried out on the  database of the Cranet Research from 2015/2016,  by using the SPPS software. The work itself is  structured in a way that the introductory  considerations, is followed by a review of the  literature referring to e-HRM, while in the second  part of the paper the explanation of the research  methodology, the presentation of the research  results,  their  discussion  and  concluding  considerations are derived.    1. The review of the literature In order to better understand the e-HRM concept,  we will first give an overview of the meaning of  another term commonly used, which is the Human  Resource Information System (HRIS). When it  comes to the Human Resources Information  System, it implies systematic procedures for  collecting, storing, maintaining, updating and  distributing data on human resources of the  organization (Tannenbaum, 1990), where the  main user of this system is the HRM function  (Ruel, Bondarouk & Looise, 2004). The goal of  using this information system is to improve the  performance of the HRM function by which it  indirectly exerts a positive influence on the entire  operation of the organization. On the other hand,  when it comes to e-HRM, this concept refers to  the application of strategies, policies and practices  related to human resources in organizations with  support or full reliance on web technology (Ruel,  Bondarouk & Looise, 2004, p. 365) whereby this  technology can be used by employees of HRM  department, as well as other employees in the  organization, potential employees, as well as the  management  of  the  organization  (Bradić  Martinović, 2011). Summarizing the difference  between e-HRM and HRIS, Ruel and his  associates (Ruel, Bondarouk & Looise, 2004)  indicated that the HRIS includes systems that are  only used by the HRM department, while the aim  of e-HRM is primarily to serve to the other users,  too.  Regarding the term e-HRM itself, its origin  has been linked to the 1990s, with the idea of the  emergence of e-commerce (Lengnick-Hall &  Moritz, 2003). Thus, according to the reputation  of e-commerce, the prefix ë" was used in HRM,  which resulted in the name of the e-HRM concept  (Ha, 2011, p. 20). However, when it comes to  understanding the essence of the e-HRM concept,  it is noticeable that there is still no single view.   24 Berber et al.        Electronic Human Resource Management (e-HRM): А New Concept for Digital Age STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT, Vol. 23 (2018), No. 2, pp. 022-032 This is explained by the fact that different authors  put emphasis on different aspects of e-HRM.  Thus, when explaining the essence of e-HRM,  some authors place an emphasis on the  transactional side of e-HRM, that is, the fact that  HRM activities are more easily administered,  other authors, place emphasis on technology that  provides access to human resources data, while  the third group of authors puts emphasis on the  strategic aspect of e-HRM.   When it comes to  the first group of authors, some of them point out  that e-HRM is such a concept in which it enables  improvements in the administration of human  resource activities and transactions (Kettley, &  Reilly, 2003, p. 3). Similarly, Voermans and Van  Veldhoven (2007, p. 887) point out that e-HRM  represents administrative support for HRM by  using internet technology. When it comes to the  second group of perceptions, where the focus is  on technology, it is stated that e-HRM implies the  application of IT for networking or support  between at least two individual or collective  entities in their realization of HRM activities  (Strohmeier, 2007, p. 20). Also, in this group of  views, it is the belief that e-HRM represents the  application of different types of technologies that  enable managers and employees to have a direct  access to human resources data and various  administrative applications (Watson & Wyatt,  2002, p. 43). We also mention Bondarouk and  Brewster (2016) that indicate that e-HRM focuses  on all integration mechanisms and all the content  of  human  resources  management  that  is  transmitted through IT, which aims to make the  HRM processes more consistent, more efficient,  with better quality, and which should create longterm opportunities for the stakeholders of the  organization. Finally, when it comes to the third  group of authors, it is indicated that e-HRM is, in  fact, a comprehensive name that covers all  possible mechanisms and interactions between  HRM and IT aimed at creating value for  employees and managers in the organization, as  well as for entities outside of them (Bondarouk &  Ruel 2009, p. 507).  However, if it were necessary to provide the  simplest definition of e-HRM, then e-HRM  represents cross-cutting and interrelation between  HRM and IT, or the use of web technologies for  the implementation of policies, practices, and  procedures of HRM (Ruel, Bondarouk & Looise,  2004).  E-HRM,  in  fact,  consists  of  the configuration of computer hardware, software and  electronic networks that enable the execution of  HRM activities. At the same time, the degree of  physical presence of hardware and software and  the degree to which they are used to coordinate  individual and group transactions in the HRM  area, irrespective of the geographical constraints  and  organizational  horizontal  and  vertical  differentiation of users, determines the level of  development  of  e-HRM  in  organizations  (Marler,& Parry, 2016).  Since there are differences in understanding  the role of e-HRM in organizations (but also in  the level of applied hardware and software  development), it is natural that there are  differences in e-HRM levels. In this regard, Lepak  and Snell (1998) consider that there are three  levels of e-HRM: operational, relational and  transformational. In the opinion of the abovementioned authors, the operational e-HRM refers  to the administration of data related to earnings of  employees, as well as their personal data. Thanks  to the application of IT in this domain, employees  are able to update themselves on their own, or that  may be done by HR staff. The goal of applying IT  for these needs is to reduce costs and increase the  efficiency of the HRM function or to have as  many transactions as possible in the unit of time,  especially when it comes to calculating earnings.  Practice truly confirms that the introduction of eHRM enables the increase in the efficiency of the  HRM function through reduction of personnel in  the human resources service, increasing the speed  in the process realization, reducing costs and  relieving staff from administrative tasks (Ruеl,  Bondarouk & Looise, 2004; Strohmeier, 2007;  Bondarouk, Parry & Furtmueller, 2017; Micu,  Capatina, Micu & Schin, 2017).  When it comes to relational eHRM Lepak  and Snell (1998), point to the IT support for  business processes through its application in the  field of employee training, recruitment of  candidates, employee performance management,  etc. Thus, for example, the application of IT in  recruiting of candidates enables this activity to be  performed by advertising of the need to fill a job  position via an organization's website or through  specialized sites. In addition, interested candidates  can also apply by the IT and the Internet. An  overview of other HRM activities in whichIT  finds its application is given in Table 1.    Berber et al.

Finally, when it comes to the third level of eHRM, which Lepak and Snell (1998) designate as  the transformational e-HRM, it is, in their  opinion, related to the realization of activities in  the HRM area that have a strategic importance for  the  organization  which  are  knowledge  management,  employee  development  in  accordance with the strategic goals of the  organization, support to virtual teams, information  exchange, etc. However, about the extent to which  these activities will really have an impact on the  formulation  and  implementation  of  the  organization's strategy, there are different points  of view. Some authors point out that e-HRM has  not yet used its potential to raise the strategic  importance of HRM function in the organization  (Tansley, Newell,& Williams, 2001). On the other  hand, there are points of view based on empirical  research according to which e-HRM has enabled  better integration of the HRM function with the  organizational strategy (Ruel, Bondarouk &  Looise, 2004). Finally, there is also research that  has shown that e-HRM is more generally used for  administrative purposes than for making strategic  decisions, but that there are some organizations in  which e-HRM provided a better quality of  information on human resources than in the case  of organizations which do not use e-HRM  (Burbach & Dundon, 2005).  From the stated levels of implementation of eHRM, the key objectives of introducing this  concept are also derived. These are: increasing the  efficiency of HR policies and procedures (Obeidat, 2016), increasing operational efficiency,  improving the quality of services provided and  increasing the strategic importance of the HRM  function (Lepak & Snell, 1998). Parry and Tyson  (2011, p. 336) added two more goals: empowering  managers to carry out various activities from the  HRM domain as well as standardization of  procedures from this area. However, Armstrong  (mentioned in Slavić & Berber, 2013, p. 239) has  an even more detailed approach, which states that  the implementation of the e-HRM concept enables  the improvement of activities and processes from  the HRM domain by achieving the following   goals:  ▪ improve quality of information available,  ▪ reduce the administrative burden on the HR  department,  ▪ improve the speed at which information is  available,  ▪ improve the flexibility of information to  support business planning,  ▪ improve services to employees,  ▪ produce HR metrics,  ▪ aid human capital reporting,  ▪ improve productivity,  ▪ reduce operational costs and  ▪ manage people’s working time more  effectively.    However, despite the indisputable advantages  of implementing the e-HRM concept, certain  potential shortcomings and challenges are also   26 Berber et al.        Electronic Human Resource Management (e-HRM): А New Concept for Digital Age STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT, Vol. 23 (2018), No. 2, pp. 022-032 present. A few of them stand out as key are (Kaur,  2013, p. 37):    ▪ Illegal access and use of information: This  is one of the main disadvantages of e-HRM  because the data contained in the databases  is available to anyone who can access them  in a lawful or illegal manner and that these  data can be used for different purposes. In  other words, they can be ḧacked", deleted,  etc.  ▪ Lack  of  appropriate  staff:  Although  implementation of the e-HRM concept can  be motivated by a reduction in the number  of employees, there may be a lack of staff  within the HRM function that possesses the  appropriate technical KSAs necessary for  the implementation and servicing of the eHRM system, so there may be a need for  their recruitment and related costs.  ▪ Errors when entering data: In order to  successfully operate the e-HRM system, it  is  necessary  to  avoid  errors  when  programming this system, but also when  using different applications. However,  whenever the human error factor is  concerned, they are not excluded.  ▪ Interpersonal contacts are reduced: Since  the implementation of the e-HRM concept  mainly involves individual work, the  number  of  employees'  interpersonal  contacts is reduced when performing work  tasks, which in some of them can lead to  the feelings of isolation.  ▪ Inadequate use of the e-HRM capabilities  due to the inflexible way of thinking of  employees: In order to make full use of the  benefits provided by the e-HRM concept,  employees within the HRM function  change the way they think, as many have  proven to be certain about the use of  modern technology as such, but also its  possibilities. However, if transformations  in the technology of carrying out work  tasks  are  not  accompanied  by  a  transformation of the way of thinking and  organizational culture, the introduction of  the e-HRM concept can be transformed  into a "financial fiasco".  ▪ The threat to the function of HRM. Since  the implementation of the e-HRM concept  can lead to a surplus of employees in this  function, the basic postulates on which the  significance of this function is based, that  is, the human resource is the most important resource of an organization that  enables the achievement of its goals and  mission, will be demolished.    In the end, it should be emphasized that the  mere introduction of the e-HRM concept is not  without challenge, as any change, especially  radical, and that it can cause more or less  resistance. Since this concept has been in use for  some time, it is possible to specify certain  recommendations that would be useful to take into  account during its implementation. Namely,  before it is considered that a particular aspect of  the e-HRM is being implemented, it is necessary  to ensure the acceptance of change by employees  and other stakeholders and ensure that the new  processes in the implementation of HRM  activities are aligned with the entire HRM system.  In addition, it is necessary to train staff how to  perform the previous activities in a new way using  IT and appropriate applications. In all this,  support and commitment of top management for  all entities involved in the implementation of this  concept is needed (Nivlouei, 2014, p. 153).  In order to investigate the level of the  application of e-HRM in organizations in Serbia,  the authors of the paper have explored empirical  data. In the following part, we presented the  methodology of the Cranet project and the results  of the analysis.    2. Methodology The research in this paper was based on the data  of the Cranet research, the international network  of business schools. This international network,  coordinated by Cranfield School Management,  organizes  comparative  research  on  human  resource policy and practice using a standardized  questionnaire. The research is carried out every  four years (Steinmetz,Schwens, Wehner, & Kabst,  2011; Brewster, Mayrhofer, & Reichel, 2011) in  over 40 countries of the world (Lazarova,Morley,  & Tyson, 2008).  The aim of the research is to provide highquality data for the academic, public and private  sectors,  as  well  as  for  human  resource  management  students,  and  to  create  new  knowledge about human resource management  practice in different countries of the world. The  questionnaire is translated into the language of the  country in which the survey is conducted, thus  achieving  local  adjustment  and  a  clearer  understanding of the issue. The standardized  questionnaire used in the research is divided into   Berber et al.        Electronic Human Resource Management (e-HRM): А New Concept for Digital Age 27 STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT, Vol. 23 (2018), No. 2, pp. 022-032 six parts: HRM activities in an organization,  staffing  practice,  employee  development,  compensation and benefits, relationships with  employees  and  communications,  and  organizational details (Leković, Slavić, & Berber,  2015; Slavić, Bjekić, & Berber, 2017).  As the only member of the international  scientific network from Serbia, in 2008, for the  first time, the Faculty of Economics in Subotica,  University of Novi Sad, participated in an  international  study  on  human  resources  management  activities  with  50  analyzed  organizations. In the first half of 2015, 160  organizations from the territory of Serbia were  investigated. Answers to questionnaires were  provided by executive managers or HR managers  in organizations with more than 50 employees.    Table 2   Structure of organizations surveyed by a number  of employees (N = 160)    Organization size (by number  of employees)  Frequency  % 1-249  97 60.6 250-1000  42 26.3 1000+  21 13.1 Total  160  100.0 Source: Research of the authors based on the Cranet data for Serbia.    The data from Table 2 indicate that the largest  share of analyzed organizations in Serbia in 2015  was in the group of small and medium enterprises  (60.6% of organizations), according to the number  of employees, from 1 to 250 workers. Large  companies were around 27% (over 250 workers in  the organization). Very large enterprises, over  1000 workers, made up 13% of the total sample.

The data from Table 3 indicate that the largest  share of analyzed organizations in Serbia was in  the private sector, 66%, while in the public there  are 34% organizations.   About 45% of enterprises are engaged in  production, while around 55% of organizations are in the service sector. The largest share of  organizations analyzed in 2015 in Serbia are from  food, trade, telecommunications and IT sectors.  For the purposes of this research and pointing  to the practice of using e-HRM in organizations,   the following variables have been analyzed:  ▪ Use of the e-HRM in an organization;  ▪ Use  of  the  self-service  system  for  managers;  ▪ Use  of  the  self-service  system  for  employees.    For the purpose of a more detailed analysis,  the mentioned variables were placed in relation to  the variables of the size, sector, and industry of  the enterprise in order to determine the level of  use and representation of these systems in  organizations in the Republic of Serbia. Data  analysis was done using the SPSS statistical  program, by using descriptive statistics and the  Spearman’s Chi-Square test.    3. Results Data from figure 1 shows the frequency of using  e-HRM for the implementation of HRM activities.  The data indicate that 58% of organizations in  Serbia on a sample of 160 companies use this  system to provide HR activities to their  employees. 42% of organizations do not use eHRM.  The module for self-service managers for  performing various HRM activities is used by  only ¼ of surveyed organizations (around 26%),  while the vast majority of companies still do not  have this opportunity for their managers. This  system allows managers to access data on  employees  with  whom  specific  managers  cooperate, enabling them to perform certain HR  activities  (for  example  approving  holiday  requests, tracking the absence of employees,  setting up and tracking the achievement of  employee goals, approving costs, proposing  employees for promotion, analyzing information  about failures and abandonment of organizations,  etc.).   The employee self-service module enables  human resource professionals and employees to  manage employee-based data. They can, if it is  foreseen by the level of access to the system, have  insight into all their data, and some data may  change. Depending on the specific solution in the  enterprise, access to data can be provided within  the intranet, and then the security of the system is   28 Berber et al.        Electronic Human Resource Management (e-HRM): А New Concept for Digital Age STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT, Vol. 23 (2018), No. 2, pp. 022-032 higher, but also via the internet, in which case the  availability of data is greater (Bradić-Martinović,  2011, p. 187). According to Figure 1, it is evident  that around 1/5 of the analyzed organizations use this module, or more precisely 18.4%. The largest  percentage of organizations from Serbia does not  offer the possibility of independent access of  employees to the data on staff.  Figure 1   Representation of e-MLP in organizations in Serbia (%)  Source: Research of the authors based on the Cranet data for Serbia.    Since the e-HRM usage frequencies are shown  and the self-access module for HR data for  managers and employees, in the following part of  the text data on the mentioned variables are  attached to the HRM strategy, HR department,  and business strategy, as a determinant of the  strategic approach to HRM. According to the data in Table 4, it is evident  that if organizations have HR departments, then eHRM, self-service for managers and employees  modules will be represented in a larger part of  organizations.

In the case of e-HRM use, data indicate that if  organizations have a specific HRM strategy, then  73% of organizations will use e-HRM (2 =  20,512; p = 0,000). The strength of this  relationship is expressed by the coefficient Phi =  0.358 (p = 0.000), which indicates that this is a  weak, statistically significant link between the  observed binary variables. In the case of selfservice for managers, the data indicate that if there  is an HR strategy in the organization, about 37%  of organizations will use the mentioned module (2 = 13,923; p = 0,000). The strength of this  relationship is expressed by the coefficient Phi =  0.295 (p = 0.000), which indicates that this is a  weak, statistically significant link between the  observed binary variables. When considering data  on the use of self-service for employees, it is  evident that if there is a strategy for HRM in the  organization, then 27% of organizations will also  use an independent approach for an employee to  use staff data (2 = 10,969; p = 0.001). The  strength of this relationship is expressed by the  coefficient Phi = 0.263 (p = 0.001), which  indicates that this is a weak, statistically  significant link between the observed binary  variables.

In the case of using e-HRM, the data indicate  that if there is a business strategy in the  organization, then 63.3% of organizations will use  e-HRM(2 = 13.541; p = 0.000). The strength of  this relationship is expressed by the coefficient  Phi = 0,291 (p = 0,000), which indicates that this  is a weak, statistically significant link between the  observed binary variables. In the case of the use  of self-service for managers, the data indicate that  if there is a business strategy for the organization,  about 28% of the organizations will use the  mentioned module (2= 4,937; p = 0.026). The  strength of this relationship is expressed by the  coefficient Phi = 0.176 (p = 0.026), which  indicates that this is a weak, statistically  significant link between the observed binary  variables. When considering data on the use of the  self-service system for employees, it is evident  that if there is a business strategy in the  organization, then 21% of organizations will also  use an independent approach to employee data on  employees (2 = 4.897; p = 0.027). The strength  of this relationship is expressed by the coefficient  Phi = 0.177 (p = 0.027), which indicates that this  is a weak, statistically significant link between the  observed binary variables.    Conclusion Over time, the role and importance of the HR  function have changed in a way that changed the  attitude towards the human capital, but also in a  way how technological changes occurred, since it  always provides a framework for structuring  business processes and activities. More recently,  this feature gets a very powerful ally for its  development in the form of IT and electronic  systems. Namely, owing to the IT and electronic  systems transactional, daily, HR activities such as  monitoring and attendance records, absences, sick  leave, annual leave, salary payments, benefits,  stimulation, training, tracking achievement of  goals, duration of employment and completion of work contract of employees, the planning of  necessary workers in relation to the dynamics of  the work of the organization, etc., are carried out  faster, more accurately, and easier than before. At  the same time, through this connection between  IT and HRM, the new HRM concept was  developed and named e-HRM. Taking into  account its increasingly widespread application  and importance, both for carrying out daily  transaction activities in the HR domain, as well as  for strategic management of human capital in the  organization, the paper dealt with the basic  characteristics of this concept, its advantages, and  potential challenges.  The paper points out that the key advantages  of such a system are the faster, more accurate and  easier processing of information about employees,  cost savings, the release of HR managers from  administrative tasks, increased access to HR data,  standardization of HR processes within the  company, more consistent and up-to-date data on  employees and their performance, and the like. In  short, using the e-HRM concept, this function is  able to achieve a significant positive impact on  the entire operation of the organization, as its  application  increases  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness of its work.  Although the benefits of implementing the eHRM concept are significant, as confirmed by the  research presented in this paper, e-HRM has  several shortcomings, which are also indicated.  These disadvantages are mainly attributed to the  system's inflexibility, the accuracy of the data  entered, the confidentiality of information and  legal issues, such as system abuse and internet  networks during working hours. It is necessary to  pay attention to all these potential hazards, since  e-HRM should primarily facilitate and speed up  the HR process, rather than slowing it down and  caving.  The paper also presents the results of an  analysis of the data on the use of the e-HRM  system in organizations in the Republic of Serbia.  The data showed that in Serbia, only half of the  organizations, out of 160 respondents, use such  systems. In the case of the use of the  system/module for self-servicefor managers and  employees, this percentage of organizations is   Berber et al.        Electronic Human Resource Management (e-HRM): А New Concept for Digital Age 31 STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT, Vol. 23 (2018), No. 2, pp. 022-032 even smaller, only ¼ organizations in terms of  managers, and 1/5 when it comes to other  employees. When considering the use of e-HRM  in relation to the existence of HR department, HR  strategies  and  business  strategies  in  the  organization, in all cases, organizations use eHRM and modules for independent data access to  a greater extent when possessing mentioned  elements. This tells us that the development of the  HRM process, viewed from a strategic angle,  contributes to the understanding, implementation  and the use of modern technological achievements  in this field.  The practical implication of this paper is  reflected in the presentation of the most important  e-HRM opinions, highlighting the benefits, but  also the constraints that managers need to know  and analyze if they decide on the introduction of  e-HRM. Also, as the HR process is an integral  part of the wider business process, it is important  to know all the implications of the e-HRM  application. Introducing organizations with eHRM capabilities allow for a more secure and  successful implementation of such a system,  which can lead to different benefits, which have  already been mentioned several times in the work.  E-HRM is especially important for organizations  in Serbia since only about half of the  organizations use it. The introduction of such a  system could lead to cost savings and greater  efficiency in HR departments and other business  processes. Also, since e-HRM allows for less time  spent on administrative activities, HR experts  could pay more attention to strategic outcomes in  HR, which would significantly strengthen the  position and importance of the HR function in  organizations. This is particularly important if we  have in mind that all developed economies of the  world and successful organizations are based on  the assumption that employees, as human capital,  are one of the main factors of success and a  sustainable competitive position in modern  business.
