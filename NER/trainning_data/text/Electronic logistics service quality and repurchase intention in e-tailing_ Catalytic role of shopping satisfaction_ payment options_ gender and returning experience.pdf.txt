Further, this paper investigates the moderating role of gender, payment options, and returns or replacement experience on the link between e-LSQ and shopping satisfaction (and  repurchase intention). Empirical data comprising 640 Indian online shoppers are analyzed with covariance-based  structural equation modeling. The findings indicated that the condition of the shipment is the most crucial e-LSQ  dimension and its linkage with shopping satisfaction varies across payment options, gender, and returning  experience. The poor condition of the shipment might have triggered the returns in e-tailing in the Indian  context. The findings will help e-tail managers design a robust logistics network to retain and win despondent  customers.1. IntroductionE-tailing has evolved through the offering of more standardized products, wider product varieties, fulfillment quality, preferred delivery  time slots, order accuracy, free shipping, discounts, cash-on-delivery  payment option, easy return and exchange policies. Logistics is often a  differentiator and competitive advantage in e-tailing companies  (Nguyen et al., 2019; Tang and Veelenturf, 2019). Booming e-tailing has  also triggered growth in the e-tail logistics sector in India. In 2018, the  industry was valued at $ 1.45 billion and was expected to grow at 36  percent in the next three years (KPMG, 2018). However, lack of logistics  infrastructure and the poor e-fulfillment services pose challenges for  logistics service providers (LSPs) in India (KPMG, 2018). Poor logistics  infrastructure not only increases the delivery time but also damages the  products during shipment. Logistics transactions of e-tailing are often  outsourced, usually performed by third-party logistics (3 PL) (Rabinovich et al., 2007). Some e-tailers have developed their in-house captive  logistics in addition to 3 PL.  Researchers and practitioners have identified the electronics logistics  service quality (e-LSQ) of the LSPs as the most critical operation for etailers (Cao et al., 2018; Hüseyino˘glu et al., 2018; Koufteros et al., 2014;  Murfield et al., 2017). Further, e-LSQ also leads to satisfaction andretention of customers (Murfield et al., 2017; Rao et al., 2011). Shopping  satisfaction is an essential determinant of repurchase intention (Yi and  La, 2004); however, the link between shopping satisfaction and  repurchase intentions is complex (Balabanis et al., 2006; Leuschner  et al., 2013). Balabanis et al. (2006) found no significant relationship  between satisfaction and loyalty, whereas Liao et al. (2017) argued  satisfaction as the strongest predictor of repurchase intention. It motivated us to test the relevance of the indirect path of e-LSQ to repurchase  intention through shopping satisfaction.  In India, LSPs deliver more than 1.9 million shipments daily (KPMG,  2018). Serving a large number of shipments and ensuring satisfaction  concerning e-LSQ is a big challenge for e-tailers. Customer segmentation  based on customer demographics and contextual factors like payment  options could help LSPs to prioritize the shipments.  Different payment options, specifically cash-on-delivery (COD), have  generated trust in the mindsets of customers towards online shopping in  the developing countries. Customers in tier-II and tier-III cities usually  preferred the COD payment option and triggered approximately  50–55% of total online retail shipments (KPMG, 2018). However, post  demonetization and the digital India initiative by the Government of  India, consumers switched to innovative payment options like mobile  wallets in addition to cards and COD. Fig. 1 shows that the share of COD* Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: nkjain@imt.edu (N.K. Jain), hasmukh@iimidr.ac.in (H. Gajjar), bhavinj@iimidr.ac.in (B.J.

Despite  this, COD remains one of the most preferred payment options by consumers in the Indian context.  COD provides an opportunity to encourage non-digital customers  towards online shopping (Hawk, 2004). Previous literature on payment  methods focused on comparing cash and credit card payments on the  level of transparency offered by them (Boden et al., 2020; Gafeeva et al.,  2018). They relied on the ‘pain of paying’ approach, that is, pain arising  for making payments for shopping and parting with cash, and found that  cash payments result in higher pain than credit card payments (Prelec  and Loewenstein, 1998; Runnemark et al., 2015; Soman, 2003). However, the role of payment methods on the relationship between the  condition of shipment and shopping satisfaction (and repurchase  intention) has not received attention. The above studies stirred us to test  the moderating effect of payment options on the relationship condition  of shipment and shopping satisfaction (and repurchase intention).  Twenty percent of online shoppers in the year 2015 were females  (Kearney, 2016), which further increased to 29.2 percent in 2019 (Statistica, 2020a). Gender influences consumer behavior in the retailing  context, and often marketers deploy gender-based segmentation strategies to meet the expectations of consumers (Friedmann and Brueller,  2018; Vaidyanathan and Aggarwal, 2020). Gender differences are  attributed to different factors like biological, psychological, social, and  behavioral (Faqih, 2016; Venkatesh and Morris, 2000; Zhang et al.,  2011). According to sociobiological theory, men are more instrumental,  and women are more experiential (Faqih, 2016; Saad and Vongas,  2009). Females take more interest in off-line shopping as compared to  men (Hansen and Jensen, 2009), while men are more likely to shop  online as compared to women (Zhang et al., 2011). Gender-based differences have been studied in pricing related issues in online retailing as  well (Friedmann and Brueller, 2018). Limited research has analyzed the  impact of gender on the relationship between the condition of shipment  and shopping satisfaction (and repurchase intention).  During online shopping, females are more likely to be concerned  with e-LSQ compared to males (Chou et al., 2015; Herter et al., 2014).  Hence, the relationship between the order condition of the shipment and  shopping satisfaction (and repurchase intention) may differ significantly  based on gender (Garbarino and Strahilevitz, 2004; Sanchez-Franco  et al., 2009). Therefore, we studied the moderating role of gender in the  relationship between the condition of the shipment and shoppingsatisfaction (and repurchase intention).  E-tailers face specific challenges like lower switching costs (Jain  et al., 2017), feel and a touch of the products (Faqih, 2016), and virtual  firm-consumer interaction (Davari et al., 2016). Negative perceptions of  customers are also reflected by a higher cart abandonment rate of 88.05  percent in 2020 (Statistica, 2020b) and increased product returns and  exchanges. According to a study (KPMG, 2018), in the year 2017, an  average of 20% of online orders placed in India was returned. Product  returns, if handled well, could help in retaining customers (Mollenkopf  et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2019). Online retailers often offer a liberal  returns policy, ‘no questions asked’ return policies and view returns as  an opportunity to reduce negative perceptions of customers (Jeng,  2017), converting them to repurchase online (Javed and Wu, 2019) and  retain them (Mollenkopf et al., 2011). However, liberal returns policies  result in increased reverse logistics costs (Anderson et al., 2009), and  therefore e-tailers also look for opportunities to reduce the returns. Poor  logistics infrastructure of India may damage the shipment during transit,  and it may trigger returns. Consequently, we analyzed the moderating  role of returns on the relationship of the condition of the shipment and  shopping satisfaction (and repurchase intention).  The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: A literature re-view on the e-LSQ and theory development is carried out in the next  section. We then present a research methodology related to our sampling technique and data collection in section 3. After presenting the  statistical analysis in section 4, theoretical and managerial implications  are discussed in Section 5. The paper is concluded by highlighting the  limitations of the study and future research opportunities in section 6.2. Literature Review and theory developmentThe literature review was performed in four phases. In the first phase, the theoretical framework was developed by reviewing extant  literature pertinent to e-LSQ. Next, the role of shopping satisfaction in  mediating the relationship between e-LSQ and repurchase intention was  conjectured. In the second phase, an extant review of the literature  resulted in hypotheses development to study the moderating role of  payment options between e-LSQ and shopping satisfaction (and  repurchase intention). Hypotheses development to test the moderating  role of gender and returns was carried out in the third and fourth phases,  respectively. Table 1 highlights the summary of the literature review.2.1. Conceptual FrameworkExisting literature on service quality in online retailing has dealt with  website quality (Parasuraman et al., 2005; Zeithaml et al., 2002);  physical distribution service quality (Hüseyino˘glu et al., 2018; Koufteros  et al., 2014; Rabinovich and Bailey, 2004; Xing et al., 2010) and reverse  logistics (Griffis et al., 2012; Jiang and Rosenbloom, 2005; Mollenkopf  et al., 2007; Towers and Xu, 2016). Physical distribution service quality  dimensions, such as product availability, timely product delivery,  shipment condition, and order billing accuracy upon arrival, are  essential for making at-purchase decisions (Koufteros et al., 2014;  Rabinovich and Bailey, 2004; Xing et al., 2010). Physical distribution  service quality includes information related to tracking of shipment  (Mentzer et al., 1989; Towers and Xu, 2016), and it is relevant to service  quality (Rabinovich and Bailey, 2004) in e-fulfillment. Mentzer et al.  (1989) operationalized order fulfillment primarily in three dimensions,  namely, product availability, timely delivery, and condition of the  shipment on arrival. Based on the above literature, we found that  product availability, timeliness, and shipment condition on arrival are  critical dimensions of e-fulfillment (Koufteros et al., 2014; Murfield  et al., 2017; Rao et al., 2014).  Availability measures the capability to manage inventory, that is,  availability of a product in stock during order procurement, information  regarding the availability of a product if it is out-of-stock or substitute  products (Xing et al., 2010). “Timeliness refers to whether products orFig. 1.

Condition measures the accuracy and quality of an order (Xing et al.,  2010). In this study, we have used shopping satisfaction and repurchase  intention to measure customer expectations. Shopping satisfaction  measures the customer’s satisfaction based on the prior purchasing  experience with an e-tailer, including pre-purchase, during-purchase,  and post-purchase experience (Khalifa and Liu, 2007; Yi and La, 2004)  while repurchase intention represents attitudinal aspects of customer  loyalty. Specifically, since repurchase intentions are related to repeat  purchases and recommendations, they are critical determinants of  customer loyalty (Mittal and Kamukura, 2001). The direct relationship  between e-LSQ and repurchase intention has already been studied in the  literature. However, the mediating role of shopping satisfaction between  e-LSQ and repurchase intention relationship has received scant attention  in the existing literature. Therefore, this study attempts to explore the  mediating role of shopping satisfaction between e-LSQ and repurchase  intention.  The proposed framework (refer Fig. 2) shows e-LSQ positively in-fluences online shopping satisfaction (Jain et al., 2015; Rao et al., 2011),  and shopping satisfaction is antecedent to repurchase intention (Javed  and Wu, 2019; Rose et al., 2012). Davis-Sramek et al. (2009) found the  mediating effect of satisfaction between order fulfillment service quality  and commitment. Soh et al. (2015) found the mediating effect of satisfaction between technical quality and loyalty. Murfield et al. (2017)  studied the mediating effects of satisfaction between LSQ and customer  loyalty. Previous literature suggests the significance of the indirect path  between e-LSQ and repurchase intention through shopping satisfaction.  Hence, we propose the following hypotheses:H1. Shopping satisfaction mediates the effect of product availability  on the repurchase intention of shoppers.H2. Shopping satisfaction mediates the effect of delivery timeliness on  the repurchase intention of shoppers.H3. Shopping satisfaction mediates the effect of shipment condition on  the repurchase intention of shoppers.2.2. Impact of payment optionsThe payment option is a significant attribute of online retailing. Due  to low credit card penetration, lack of trust in digital payments, and  cultural preferences in developing countries, shoppers prefer the cash on  delivery and pay the money after inspecting the shipment (Hawk, 2004).  “COD makes sense in India because banks offer door-to-door cashdelivery services, people keep large sums of cash at home, and large  transactions are made in cash” (Kshetri, 2007). Leading e-tailers in India  have also recognized these psychological barriers towards online payments and offered the COD payment option to the shoppers to enhance  their trust in online shopping.  Payment options and its relationship with consumer spending  behavior has received significant attention in the literature. Runnemark  et al. (2015) argued consumer’s willingness to pay is higher when  consumers pay with debit cards than with cash. Similarly, Gafeeva et al.  (2018) found that consumer’s willingness to pay is more elevated when  consumers pay with credit cards than cash. These studies argued that the  card (either credit card or debit card) payments reduce payment transparency and consumer’s recall accuracy of shopping and therefore  reduce the payment related pain for the customers (Gafeeva et al., 2018;  Runnemark et al., 2015; Soman, 2003). Customers opted for non-COD  payment options are more concerned with the condition of the shipment as they pay for the shipment in advance. Therefore, it would be  interesting to explore the moderating role of payment options in the  relationship between shipment condition and shopping satisfaction (and  repurchase intention) with the following hypotheses:H4. The payment options moderate the relationship between the  shipment condition and shopping satisfaction, such that the degree of  the relationship is higher for shoppers using non-COD payment options.H5. The payment options moderate the relationship between the  shipment condition and repurchase intention, such that the degree of the  relationship is higher for shoppers using non-COD payment options.2.3. Role of genderSignificant gender differences exist in the usage of information and  communication technologies, internet, and emails (Awad and Ragowsky, 2008; Cyr and Bonanni, 2005; Garbarino and Strahilevitz, 2004;  Kim et al., 2011; Sanchez-Franco et al., 2009). As compared to men,  women found shopping as fun and enjoyed shopping more (Chou et al.,  2015). Significant gender differences were observed in the perceptions  of (i) communication technologies (Gefen and Ridings, 2005), (ii)  e-tailers’ website related features and website satisfaction (Cyr and  Bonanni, 2005), and (iii) internet usage (Sánchez-Franco, 2006). Also,  ease of using computer influenced women’s decisions and men’s purchase decisions (Venkatesh and Morris, 2000). Awad and Ragoswsky  (2008) found that women have a stronger effect than men on the effect  of trust on intention in online shopping. Females are affected by the  physical attributes of the product and shop more than men  (Sánchez-Franco, 2006). Kim et al., 2011 found that e-services attributes  differ across gender. Sanchez-Franco et al. (2009) found that the influence of commitment and trust on loyalty was stronger for women than  men. Women were found more tolerant and were more likely to  repurchase than men, and they give higher satisfaction ratings than men  (Mittal and Kamukura, 2001). Hwang and Lee (2018) found that women  pay more visual attention to shopping information and shopping attitude, whereas men pay more visual attention to product information.  Atulkar and Kesari (2018) found that females have a stronger relationship between materialism and store environment with impulse buying  than men, indicating females are highly materialistic consumer than the  male consumer.  Previous literature has also studied the moderating influence of  gender on the relationship between service quality elements and  behavioral loyalty as well as attitudinal loyalty variables (Darley and  Luethge, 2019; Kim et al., 2011; Sharma et al., 2012). The positive association between service quality and satisfaction was much stronger for  women as compared to men (Sharma et al., 2012). Mortimer and Clarke  (2011) found that the men are more concerned with the functional  utilities, that is, transaction speed, convenience, and efficiency. In  contrast, women, on the other hand, are more concerned with experiential or relational utilities than men in a supermarket store. Hence it  Fig. 2. Conceptual framework.N.K. Jain et al.Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services xxx (xxxx) xxx5can be inferred that gender would influence the relationship between  the condition of the shipment and shopping satisfaction (and repurchase  intention) in the context of online retailing. Further, condition measures  relational utility as the delivery boy delivers the product to consumers  and then consumers evaluate the shipment, therefore, females would  have stronger influence on the association of condition of the shipment  on the shopping satisfaction (and repurchase intention).  Recognizing the gender differences reported in existing literature, we  propose the following hypotheses to explore the gender differences  specifically.H6. The association of shipment conditions with shopping satisfaction  will be stronger for female shoppers than male shoppers.H7. The association of shipment conditions with repurchase intention  will be stronger for female shoppers than male shoppers.2.4. Impact of returnsAfter-sales services are critical for e-tailing as it includes shipment  modification/cancellation requests, replacement, product returns, and  refunds (Grewal et al., 2004; Javed and Wu, 2019; Kalia, 2017). Though  e-tailers provide details of products through product information,  photos, videos, chat options, and virtual reality for trials (Grewal et al.,  2004), however, returns remain significantly higher in e-tailing. Product  return is a critical issue to e-tailers rather than being considered as a just  cost of doing business (Ramírez, 2012; Rao et al., 2014). The returned  product provides an opportunity to acquire new customers through  service recovery resulting in increased profitability in any organization  (Mollenkopf et al., 2011). Perceived fairness and quality in returns could  also influence the shopping satisfaction (Javed and Wu, 2019), purchase  intention (Jeng, 2017), and repurchase intention (Javed and Wu, 2019;  Wang et al., 2019) of customers. One of the reasons for higher returns in  developing countries is poor logistics infrastructure, which leads to  negative service encounters for the shoppers. However, e-tailers get a  service recovery opportunity to enhance shopping satisfaction and  repurchase intentions of the shoppers by offering excellent returning or  replacement experience.  The return or replacement experience is an undesirable outcome in  online shopping that may influence the customers’ expectations from eLSQ (Lin et al., 2011). The returns or replacement experience may influence the relationship between the shipment condition and shopping  satisfaction (and repurchase intention) such that it will increase the  degree of association between the condition and shopping satisfaction  for customers who face returns than those who don’t. Specifically,  customers are more concerned with the condition of the shipment  delivered to them.  Therefore, we propose the following hypotheses:H8. The returns or replacement experience moderate the relationship  between the condition and shopping satisfaction such that the association is higher for the shoppers experiencing the returning process.H9. The returns or replacement experience moderate the relationship  between the condition and repurchase intention such that the association is higher for the shoppers experiencing the returning process.3. Research methodologyWe present the methodology behind the pilot and main studies in this section. Initially, we describe the sampling technique to identify and  choose the target respondents. The questionnaire design is then presented in the next section. Pre-testing and pilot testing results, along  with content validity measures, are presented after that. Lastly, we  describe the data collection methodology for the main study and further  address the common method variance after data collection.3.1. Sampling techniqueCustomers with online shopping experience were the potential re-spondents for this study. Youth are active Internet users (Gafeeva et al.,  2018; Javed and Wu, 2019; Jeng, 2017; Koufteros et al., 2014) and  college students represent the profile of online customers (Javed and  Wu, 2019; Jeng, 2017; Koufteros et al., 2014). Therefore, we decided to  collect the data from students engaged in online shopping. We chose a  convenient sampling method and collected data from the students of a  large University located in Central India in the year 2018.3.2. Questionnaire designThis study targeted those customers who had purchased products  online in the last six months. The questionnaire consisted of two parts:  (i) the qualification part and (ii) the main questionnaire part. The  qualification section collected respondents’ demographic and shopping  characteristics to filter them out for the main questionnaire. The respondents were asked to indicate whether they also encountered returns  or replacement experience in the last six months. The respondents  responded to the main questionnaire for a specific e-tailer of their  choice. The main questionnaire comprised 23 close-ended items  designed to measure the eight variables used in the framework,  anchored on a seven-point Likert scale from “1 = strongly disagree” to  “7 = strongly agree”. The items used to measure each variable were  adopted and modified from existing literature (Bienstock et al., 1996;  Boyer and Hult, 2005; Parasuraman et al., 2005; Rose et al., 2012;  Koufteros et al., 2014). Details on the items used for each variable are  provided in Appendix A.3.3. Pre-test and pilot studyThe content validity of the questionnaire was established by  consulting seven academicians and five e-tail managers. Further, face  validity was established by interviewing ten frequent shoppers. The data  was collected from students of a large University located in Central  India. The students’ responses were gathered in a classroom setting; that  is, responses were collected from students already enrolled in specific  class sessions. The purpose of the study was clearly explained to those  course instructors who assisted us in our data collection. Specifically,  instructors were asked to allot 15–20 min after completing their sessions  to collect student responses. The entire questionnaire survey was  administered in paper-and-pencil form, and questionnaires were  distributed to those students in each classroom who volunteered for the  survey. Chocolates as non-monetary incentive were offered to respondents to complete the questionnaire. The respondents were asked to  complete the main questionnaire for a specific e-tailer of their choice, as  indicated in the qualifying questionnaire. On average, it took each  respondent 15 min to complete the survey. Next, a pilot survey was  administered, resulting in 95 valid responses. All the constructs attained  Cronbach’s alpha (CA) (i.e., reliability measure) values of more than 0.7  (Hair et al., 2006), as well as composite reliabilities (CR) greater than  0.7 and extracted average variances (AVE) of 0.5 or more.  The main study resulted in a total of 640 valid responses. Out of  these, 361 responses had encountered shopping experience only,  whereas 279 responses had encountered both shopping and return or  replacement experience.3.4. Common method varianceSelf-report surveys suffer from method biases (Podsakoff et al.,  2003). Reverse coded items on a 7-point Likert scale were used during  the questionnaire design stage, voluntary and anonymous participation  accompanied by a cover letter during the data collection stage to reduce  common method bias (Podsakoff et al., 2003; Viswanathan and  Kayande, 2012). A post-data collection statistical remedy of Harman’sN.K. Jain et al.Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services xxx (xxxx) xxx6single factor test was also carried out to address the common method  variance (Podsakoff et al., 2003). Factor analysis using unrotated principal component analysis resulted in five factors, with the largest variance of a factor as 35.12%. Since no single factor accounted for the  majority of variances, Harmon’s single factor test was successfully  validated. Thus, the common method variance was not a problem for  this study (Podsakoff et al., 2003).4. Statistical analysisIn this section, we begin with descriptive statistics of the sample then assess the measurement model using a confirmatory analysis. Next, we  carry out the assessment of the structural model and the mediation  analysis. At last, the assessment of measurement invariance and the  multi-group analysis is carried out.4.1. Sample characteristicsTable 2 indicated that the respondents in our sample majorly  belonged to the age group of 21–25 years. More than 70 percent of the  respondents purchased products once per month or once per three  months, establishing that they were frequent shoppers. About the yearly  purchase amount, the respondents were spread across the sample, confirming that the sample represent all online shoppers with different  purchase values. Around 56 percent of the respondents have purchased  products or services online and did not encounter returns, whereas 44  percent have encountered both purchasing and returning or replacement experience. Nearly 72 percent of the respondents in the sample  purchased products from an e-tailer in either the last week or month.  This purchase recency established that these respondents were active  online shoppers who could recall their recent purchase encounters with  e-tailers. Nearly 60 percent of the respondents who have returning  experience has returned the product within three months that providedevidence for returning recency. It was also found that the respondents  usually purchased items from such product categories as apparel and  electronics, which are top-selling categories in e-tailing in the Indian  context (Kearney, 2016).4.2. CB-SEM model assessmentWe used a two-stage (measurement and structural) CB-SEM  approach to analyze the model due to (i) its appropriateness for theory testing; (ii) its suitability for examining causal relationship models;  and (iii) its aptness for analyzing model with sufficiently large sample  size (Bagozzi and Yi, 1998; Hu and Bentler, 1999).  To test the hypotheses, we used AMOS 24 software. We also checked  for interaction effects amongst e-LSQ dimensions; however, no significant interaction effect of different e-LSQ dimensions was observed on  shopping satisfaction and repurchase intention.4.3. Measurement model assessmentThe measurement model obtained excellent fit with Chi-square  (CMIN = 794.887, DF = 220, p-value = 0.000), the goodness of fit  index (GFI = 0.903), the comparative fit index (CFI = 0.950), TuckerLewis coefficient (TFI = 0.942), the Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index  (AGFI = 0.879), the Normal Fit Index (NFI = 0.932), the Incremental Fit  Index (IFI = 0.950) and the root mean square of approximation (RMSEA  = 0.064, PCLOSE = 0.000) as the fit indices are better than the recommended values (Hu and Bentler 1999). Fig. 3 shows the CFA using  AMOS 24 software.  Cronbach’s alpha (CA), Composite reliability (CR), and average  variance extracted (AVE) values were found to be higher than the  specified values for all the constructs (Hair et al., 2006). Further, AVE  values were higher than the maximum shared variance (MSV), and  average shared squared variance (ASV) values provided evidence forTable 2  Sample characteristics.Gender  Male  FemaleFrequency  440  200     Percentage  68.75  31.25     Age  18–21 years  21–25 years  26–30 years  31–35 years  >35  years  Frequency  9  566  59  5  1  Percentage  1.41  88.44  9.22  0.78  0.16  Online shopping experience  Purchasing  experience  Returns or replacement  experience     Frequency  361  279     Percentage  56.41  43.59     Number of products/services purchased online  Once in a week  Once in a month  Once in 3  months  Once in 6  months   Frequency  63  254  245  78   Percentage  9.84  39.69  38.28  12.19   Amount (in INR.#) spent on purchasing products/services in the  last year  <1000  1000–3000  3001–5000  5001–10000  >10000Frequency  48  138  110  131  213  Percentage  7.50  21.56  17.19  20.47  33.28  Last time of products/services purchased online  Last week  Last month  Past 3 months  Past 6 months   Frequency  124  138  65  34   Percentage  34.35  38.23  18.01  9.42   Number of times products/services purchased from specific etailer  Once  2-5 times  6-10 times  >10 timesFrequency  350  196  44  50   Percentage  54.69  30.63  6.88  7.81   Number of products returned/replaced from specific e-tailer*  Once  2–5  6–10  >10   Frequency  206  71  2  0   Percentage  73.8  25.4  0.7  0   Last time returning or replacing a product*  Last  Last  Past 3 months  Past 6 months   Week  Month  Frequency  47  49  71  112   Percentage  16.85  17.56  25.45  40.14#1 INR. = 0.014 US$ in 2018 (source: www.xe.com); * Only for respondents who have returned or replaced the product online.N.K.

Table 3 demonstrates that  inter-construct correlations were lower than the square root of AVE for  each construct, thus establishing discriminant validity (Fornell and  Larcker, 1981). Factor loadings of individual items assessed indicator  reliability is shown in Appendix A (Hair et al., 2006).4.4. Structural model assessmentThe structural model also achieved good fit (CMIN = 1166.709, DF  = 440, p-value = 0.000, GFI = 0.868, CFI = 0.936, TFI = 0.927, AGFI = 0.834, NFI = 0.902, IFI = 0.937 and RMSEA = 0.051, PCLOSE = 0.000).  The shopping satisfaction (R2 = 0.505) and repurchase intention (R2 = 0.602) obtained moderate R2 values.4.5. Mediation analysisBaron and Kenny(1986) ‘s method was adopted to test multiple  mediations. Further, the indirect effect significance test was also used to  test for partial, full, or no mediation (Preacher and Hayes, 2004; Zhao  et al., 2010). Table 4 represents the direct and indirect effects of  e-fulfillment dimensions on repurchase intention (Step 1 and Step 2 of  Baron and Kenney (1986) ‘s approach). Table 5 represents step 3 of  Baron and Kenny (1986) ‘s approach, including all the structural path  coefficients in the presence of mediators.  When shopping satisfaction acts as a mediator, the direct effect of  timeliness and condition on repurchase intention gets reduced, whereas  the influence of availability on repurchase intention becomes insignificant. Also, the standardized indirect (mediated) effect is significantly  different from zero at the 0.05 level (p = 0.05, two-tailed). Further, a  bias-corrected confidence interval was obtained using bootstrap  approximation (Refer to Table 6). The bias-corrected confidence intervaldoes not include zero and establishes a significant indirect effect for all  the constructs (Preacher and Hayes, 2004). This shows that partial  mediation for availability (direct effect β = 0.143, p = 0.000; indirect  effect: β = 0.178, LCI = 0.059, UCI = 0.169) and condition (direct effect  β = 0.141, p = 0.000; indirect effect: β = 0.197, LCI = 0.15, UCI = 0.300)  whereas full mediation for timeliness (direct effect β = 0.046, p = 0.525;  indirect effect: β = 0.305, LCI = 0.103, UCI = 0.202) indicating support  for hypotheses H1, H2 and H3. Further, the variance accounted for  (VAF) value was calculated by taking the ratio of indirect effect to the  total effect (that is, direct plus total effect) to determine the strength of  mediation (Hair et al., 2016). VAF for availability is 55.5%, timeliness is  86.90%, and the condition is 58.30%, indicating an indirect path  through shopping satisfaction absorbs more than 50% of the direct path  for all the variables. Thus shopping satisfaction is necessary for  explaining the relationship between e-LSQ and repurchase intention.4.6. Moderation analysisMultiple group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) was per-formed to study the variation across payment options, gender, and  returning experience. Measurement invariance was done to ensure the  equivalence of a measured construct across different groups (Davidov,  2008). Measurement invariance established the fact that the same  construct is measured in each group and provides the opportunity to  compare means or factor loadings path coefficients across different  groups (Chen, 2011). Configural invariance was also carried out to  establish measurement invariance. Tables 7–9 show that all the groups  had an adequate fit.  Three conditions (namely metric invariance, scalar invariance, and  structural covariances) must be satisfied to test measurement invariance  (Davidov, 2008). Metric invariance restricts the factor loadings to be  equal across groups, but the intercepts are allowed to vary across groups.  Scalar invariance constraints both loadings and intercepts to be equalFig. 3.

Jain et al.Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services xxx (xxxx) xxx8across groups, whereas structural covariances constraints loadings, intercepts, variances, and covariances across groups. For model comparison and assessing measurement invariance, the goodness of fit index  difference (Δ goodness-of-fit index) was used (Chen, 2007; Voicu, 2010)  according to which ΔRMSEA should be less than 0.01 and ΔCFI, ΔTLI  should be less than 0.02 for a good fit. For all the cases, ΔCFI and ΔTLI  were observed below 0.02; and ΔRMSEA was found to be less than 0.01,  thus establishing measurement invariance (Refer to Tables 7–9).  After establishing the measurement invariance, the multi-group  analysis was performed by testing the significance of the difference of  path coefficients between two groups. A parametric t-test was used to  test the significant difference in path coefficients.  Payment options were classified into two categories(i) customers  opting for COD as a payment option, and (ii) customers opting for other  payment options like internet banking, debit card or credit card.  Table 10 shows that the payment options moderate the relationship  between (i) condition of the shipment and shopping satisfaction (β = −0.291, p = 0.043) and (ii) condition of the shipment and repurchase  intention (β = −0.397, p = 0.004), indicating support for hypotheses H4  and H5.  Gender was also found to moderate the relationship between (i)  condition of the shipment and shopping satisfaction (β = −0.386, p = 0.002) and (ii) condition of the shipment and repurchase intention (β = −0.448, p = 0.000), indicating support for H6 and H7 (refer Table 11).  The returning experience was classified into two categories (i)  Nonreturns: Customers who have not experienced returning or  replacement experience and (ii) Returns: Customers who have experienced returning or replacement experience. The returning experiencemoderated the relationship between the condition of the shipment and  shopping satisfaction (β = 0.359, p = 0.000), indicating support for  hypothesis H8. In contrast, the returning experience could not moderate  the relationship between the condition of the shipment and repurchase  intention (β = 0.108, p = 0.237), showing hypothesis H9 was not  accepted (refer to Table 12). The results have been reported in Fig. 4.5. Theoretical and practical implicationsThe results indicate that shopping satisfaction has a full mediation effect on the relationship between availability and repurchase intention,  whereas partial mediation between (i) timeliness-repurchase intention  and (ii) condition-repurchase intention link. The finding of the study is  similar to that of Rao et al. (2011) and Murfield et al. (2017). Thus, it  indicates that e-tailers and their logistics service providers (LSPs) should  increase the satisfaction of customers concerning e-LSQ that will increase the intent of the customers to repurchase from the same e-tailer,  thereby resulting in the retention of customers. The satisfied customers  will be repurchasing from the same e-tailers.  The moderating effect of payment options on the link between the  condition of the shipment and shopping satisfaction (and repurchase  intention) indicates that the customers who have paid the money  through the online payment option are more concerned with the condition of the shipment. This finding is consistent with the previous  literature (Gafeeva et al., 2018; Greenacre and Akbar, 2019; Runnemark  et al., 2015). Hence e-tailers and their LSPs should focus mainly on the  condition of the shipment for retaining the customers and should give  preference to the segment of customers preferring all payment options  rather than COD. It is one unique contribution of this study to the academic literature and the practitioners as well.  Gender was found to moderate the link between the condition of the  shipment and shopping satisfaction (and repurchase intention),  reflecting that females are more concerned than men towards the condition of the shipment. The findings of this study are complementary to  the literature (Mortimer and Clarke, 2011; Sánchez-Franco, 2006;  Sharma et al., 2012; Venkatesh and Morris, 2000). This again contributes to the literature, and it also provides an opportunity for the e-tail  managers to focus more on female customers.  Further, e-tailers should identify the reasons for the higher in-cidences of return as logistics is more often outsourced to LSPs by e-Table 6  Mediation analysis and Indirect effect significance Test.Hypothesis  Path  Direct effect  (c)  Direct effect in presence of  mediator (c’)  Indirect  effect  Lower  Bound  Upper  Bound  pvalue  VAFa  Mediation  DecisionH1  Avail– > RepurInt  .260***  0.143***  0.178*  0.059  0.169  0.012  0.555  Partial  AcceptedH2  Time– > RepurInt  .189***  0.046  0.305**  0.103  0.202  0.006  0.869  Full  AcceptedH3  Cond– > RepurInt  .352***  0.141**  0.197*  0.15  0.3  0.013  0.583  Partial  Accepted*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.  a VAF: variance accounted for (VAF=Indirect effect/(Direct + Indirect effect).Table 7  Measurement invariance based on payment options.Model  N  X2  DF  CFI  TLI  RMSEASingle Group CFA  COD  251  495.906  220  0.942  0.933  0.071  Others  389  605.669  220  0.944  0.936  0.067  Multi-group CFA  640  1101.67  440  0.943  0.935  0.045  Baseline  (Unconstrained)  640  1131.5  458  0.942  0.936  0.044Metric Invariance  640  1163.03  473  0.941  0.937  0.044  Scalar Invariance  640  1270.12  496  0.934  0.932  0.046  Structural Covariances  251  495.906  220  0.942  0.933  0.071Table 8  Measurement invariance based on gender.Model  N  X2  DF  CFI  TLI  RMSEASingle Group CFA  Male  440  646.015  220  0.947  0.939  0.066  Female  200  505.879  220  0.921  0.909  0.081  Multi-group CFA  Baseline  (Unconstrained)  640  1152.300  440  0.939  0.930  0.050Metric Invariance  640  1183.440  458  0.938  0.931  0.050  Scalar Invariance  640  1237.930  473  0.935  0.930  0.050  Structural Covariances  640  1331.610  496  0.928  0.927  0.051Table 9  Measurement invariance based on returning experience.Model  N  X2  DF  CFI  TLI  RMSEASingle Group CFA  Nonreturns  361  628.820  220  0.933  0.923  0.072  Returns  279  537.865  220  0.939  0.930  0.072  Multi-group CFA  Baseline  (Unconstrained)  640  1166.710  440  0.936  0.927  0.051Metric Invariance  640  1195.830  458  0.935  0.928  0.050  Scalar Invariance  640  1328.240  473  0.925  0.920  0.053  Structural Covariances  640  1663.140  496  0.898  0.895  0.061N.K.

Further investigation is required to find which one whether  outsourcing of logistics or in-adequate performance measurement of  LSPs by e-tailers is generating more returns. In market-place based  distribution channels, vendors sometimes dispatch the goods directly to  customers as against some vendors being required to bring the items to  the fulfillment center where final packaging is carried out after proper  inspection. In the latter case, the poor condition of the order can be  avoided before shipment. E-tailers can reduce returns arising due to  product inaccuracy primarily due to the mismatch between the product  description and actual offering. Despite all these interventions, should  there be a service encounter of returns, e-tailers should sincerely think of  designing their reverse logistics service architecture to regain the customers who faced returns. Thus, it may help increase the customer’s  shopping satisfaction and would pave the way for service recovery  leading to repurchase intention.  Poor logistics infrastructure in India may result in damage to the  products during shipment. Customers who have faced returning experience might have received the products in spoiled or damaged condition. Condition measures the reliability of the shipments in terms of  product quality and accuracy of the shipment. The product might have  been damaged during shipment owing to poor logistics infrastructure.  The other reason could be the inferior quality products shipped by the  supplier or inaccurate delivery of shipment. Returning experience  moderated the relationship between the condition and shopping satisfaction. This indicates that customers facing returning or replacement  experience is more concerned with the condition of the shipment. Etailers could improve the delivery conditions of the shipments if they  have control over the logistics supply chain. This includes receiving  products from the suppliers to their fulfillment centers or warehouses.  The packaging of the shipment could be monitored to reduce product  damage during transit.  Further, the accuracy of the shipment could be checked before the  start of the shipment. The findings suggest that e-tailers should opt  either for an inventory-based operations model or fulfilled by e-tailers  model. Both these models provide operations and logistics supply  functions under the control of e-tailers. Further, e-tailers should develop  their own “captive logistics arms” to increase the reliability of theshipment (KPMG, 2016).  In this way, e-tail managers would be able to improve the condition  of the shipment and simultaneously reduce returns. The reduction in  returns would provide a competitive advantage (Ramrez, 2012) to  e-tailers as returns cost increases the average logistics cost by fifty  percent (KPMG 2018). Our finding is again unique and contributes to the  literature on logistics service quality management.  In the Indian context, the condition of the shipment if the most  critical dimension. This finding is contrary to that of Murfield et al.  (2017); they found that timeliness as a most crucial dimension in the U.  S. context, whereas in the Indian context, the condition is the most  critical logistics service quality dimension since poor logistics infrastructure increases the chance of damaging of products during shipment.  E-tail managers and their LSPs should ensure that the products are not  damaged during the shipment. They should ensure product quality and  accuracy of the shipment when it reaches the customers. They should  select reliable logistics partners and ensure proper packaging (Rajesh  et al., 2011). LSPs should focus on the accuracy and reliability (i.e., good  quality) of the condition of the shipment.6. Limitations, future research directions, and conclusionFirst, this study lacked generalizability as the data was collected from Central India, and the sample was skewed towards youth. Second, this  study considered products from the product categories of consumer  electronics, apparel, and books. Future studies shall develop product  category-specific frameworks to gain deeper insights into relationships.  Third, this study focused on the ‘pain of paying’ concept to analyze the  role of payment options; however, future research can analyze how  payment options can generate trust in e-tailing. Fourth, this study didn’t  differentiate returns or product exchanges. Further, a longitudinal study  shall be carried out to strengthen the findings.  This study found that e-tailers should increase the shopping satis-faction of the customers who experienced e-LSQ, which in turn may help  to increase the intent of the customers to repeat purchase. The condition  of the shipment is the most crucial e-LSQ dimension in the Indian  context, and e-tailers should focus on improving the satisfaction andTable 10  Multi-group analysis (payment options).Hypothesis  Structural Paths  Global  COD (251)  Others (389)  Difference Path coefficient  Parametric test for difference t-value  DecisionPath coefficient  Path coefficient  Path coefficientH4  Cond– > Shopsatis  0.353***  0.16*  0.451***  −0.291**  −2.932  AcceptedH5  Cond– > RepurInt  0.141***  0.11  0.507***  −0.397***  −3.724  Accepted*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.Table 11  Multi-group analysis (gender).Hypothesis  Structural Paths  Global  Male (440)  Female (200)  Difference Path coefficient  Parametric test for difference t-value  DecisionPath coefficient  Path coefficient  Path coefficientH6  Cond– > Shopsatis  0.353***  0.22  0.606***  −0.386**  −3.163  AcceptedH7  Cond– > RepurInt  0.141***  0.219  0.667***  −0.448***  −3.475  Accepted*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.Table 12  Multi-group analysis (returning experience).Hypothesis  Structural Paths  Global  Returns (279)  Nonreturns  (361)  Difference Path  coefficient  Parametric test for difference tvalue  DecisionPath  coefficient  Path  coefficient  Path coefficientH8  Cond– > Shopsatis  0.353***  0.376***  0.017  0.359***  3.578***  AcceptedH9  Cond– > RepurInt  0.141***  0.167***  0.059  0.108  1.023  Not Accepted*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.N.K.
