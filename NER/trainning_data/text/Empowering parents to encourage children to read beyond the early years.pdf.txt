Thisarticle draws on recent research to support our school/home partnerships to keep reading apriority.Abstract:Enjoyment of reading books is related to reading proficiency, and fostering children’senjoyment of reading is imperative to support continued reading engagement. However, notall children understand that reading is important, and not all children are regularly engaged inrecreational reading. Children typically read for pleasure less often as they age, leadingresearchers to seek effective ways that social influences can support children to be life-longreaders beyond the early years. Parents can play an important role in communicating thecontinued importance of reading, and fostering positive attitudes toward reading. However,after independent reading skill acquisition, parents may become a less potent encouragingand supportive force. We explore older children’s experiences of both independent andshared reading, and their perception of parental support, involvement and modelling, tohighlight potential roles that parental figures can play to reading beyond the early years.Pause and Ponder:•  How do you currently communicate the ongoing importance of reading to parents beyond theearly years of schooling?2•  What do you know about your unique school community that can support your efforts toencourage reading at home?•  How might you identify areas in which parents may need additional support to encouragereading at home with older children, and how will you meet these needs?Josh was a softly spoken eleven-year-old boy who loved playing basketball. When Margaretasked about his reading experiences as part of a study into young people’s reading, it wasclear that reading was not one of his favourite activities, rather something he did forrecreation once every few weeks.Josh explained that he had received more encouragement as a younger child,reflecting that “they would always give me something that I thought would be fun to read,and it really was fun to read, back then.” But once Josh became a competent independentreader, this encouragement was curtailed, leading to Josh’s conclusion that while reading isstill important beyond the early years, comparatively speaking, “you don’t have to readmuch”. He explained that this is “because you already know how to read, back then you’restill learning, so you’ve got to read more to learn.”While Josh read to his mother “just for homework” when he was younger, thispractice had “stopped a few years ago”. No one read to him at home, and he had only beenread to infrequently when younger, though he had a positive attitude toward being read to,stating that “I like to just sit and enjoy”. Fortunately, his teacher read aloud to him in class,which he thought was “pretty good actually”.Josh had reached the conclusion that the purpose of reading was simply independentreading skill acquisition. Once he knew how to read, encouragement to continue doing sowas withdrawn by his parents, and he assumed that reading was no longer valuable.3However, Josh did not believe he was a skilled reader. When asked about his readingabilities, he was only able to describe them as “middleish” at best; he explained “for onething, I don’t really read very fast. I like to check myself a little bit, so I know what I’mreading. My sister finishes a book in like five minutes that’s really fat…and it would take melike two days to finish that book.” This hints at possible issues with fluency, comprehension,and perceived self-efficacy in reading, particularly due to sibling comparison. Josh ideallyshould have been reading more, not less, to further develop his skills. Josh, and perhaps hisparents, did not understand the continuing importance of reading beyond independent readingskill acquisition.Influences on children’s attitudes toward readingJosh’s understanding of the value of reading beyond independent reading skill acquisitioncould be viewed as potentially responsive to the social influences of value in his life. We useMcKenna’s (1994) model of reading attitude acquisition as a lens for considering theseissues, as it retains importance due to the enduring nature of the interplay between social andenvironmental factors, which may shape children’s beliefs about reading. Children’s attitudestoward reading are thus shaped by “normative beliefs, beliefs about the outcomes of reading,and specific reading experiences” (McKenna, Kear & Ellsworth, 1995, p. 939). Despite theparental focus of this paper, we are not suggesting that parents bear full responsibility fortheir children’s literacy engagement; while research suggests that a range of influences canaffect the way children perceive reading, here we focus on the role that parents can play, andhow teachers can shape that role. We know that “students show a better ability to read andlearn when their parents are involved in their education and when the parents themselvesvalue reading”, leading to the contention that “student learning is most effective when it isthe result of a partnership among the school, teachers, parents and the community” (OECD,42012, p. 13). Where teachers and parents work together to support children’s reading, “at-riskchildren exhibit demonstrable gains” (Darling, 2005, p. 476).Much of the research on parents’ role in supporting reading focuses on the early years(e.g. Darling & Westberg, 2004), where independent reading skill is generally beingdeveloped. However, in recent times, greater attention has been given to how parents maysupport reading as a lifelong habit beyond this point, partly in response to our growingunderstanding of the ongoing benefits of regular reading. As teachers, we work with childrenand their parents to ensure the best literacy outcomes; this paper will explore the forms ofencouragement and support children currently receive to sustain both shared and independentreading beyond the early years, in order to strengthen school/home partnerships.Benefits of regular readingWhile most individuals in Western society have achieved basic literacy skills by adulthood,functional illiteracy, where literacy levels are not sufficient to meet current academic,vocational and social demands, is a widespread issue (Zebroff & Kaufman, 2016). Manyadults to do not have sufficient literacy skills to make the most of the opportunities theyencounter in everyday life, and they may struggle with relatively basic literacy applications,such as filling out a form or writing an email to a work colleague. As research increasinglysuggests that literacy skills need to be exercised to be both further developed and maintained(e.g. Lawrence et al., 2015), a regular reading habit can play a valuable role in enabling bothyoung people and adults meet the ever-increasing literacy demands of contemporary society.In addition to offering academic, social and vocational benefits, recent findingssuggest that reading may be good for our brains and our personalities. We know that regularreading confers a range of benefits beyond the obvious literacy skill benefits; reading mayconfer protection against cognitive decline into old age (e.g. Vermuri & Mormino, 2013;Wilson et al., 2013). Regular recreational reading of fiction has also been associated with5developing an enhanced capacity for empathy and pro-social attitudes and behaviours (e.g.Mar & Oatley, 2008). The reasons to keep reading beyond the early years are burgeoning inthe research.While children are often encouraged to read anything, and diverse text types offervaluable exposure to authentic textual experiences, at this stage, the reading of books is morestrongly associated with literacy benefit than the reading of other text types. To date, readinggraphic novels, text messages, the internet (Baer, Baldi, Ayotte, & Green, 2007), and comicbooks (OECD, 2010) have not been found to offer equal literacy benefit, and fiction booksare particularly associated with literacy benefits (OECD, 2011). As such, while we encourageour children to read widely and across diverse text types and genres for exposure to otherpossible benefits, it is important that we also continue to encourage them to make books astaple component of their reading diet.Attitude and achievementInternationally, attitudes toward reading are closely linked to reading achievement.All OECD countries show a positive relationship between engagement in reading and readingachievement (Kirsch et al., 2002; OECD, 2011). However, as nations continue to grapplewith possible approaches to improve overall literacy scores, the power of recreational bookreading as an effective intervention is not necessarily well understood. Recent analysis fromWestern Australian Study in Children’s Book Reading (WASCBR) suggests that while age,gender, reading encouragement or having supportive peers were all significant influentialfactors in children's reading engagement, reading attitude was the strongest predictor ofreading frequency (Merga & Mat Roni, 2018). With this in mind, if we want young people todevelop a lifelong reading habit, we need to understand the role that social influences canplay in fostering a positive attitude toward reading, so that we can support children to have a6favourable view toward reading, and so that it can legitimately and successfully compete withthe other recreational possibilities.Reading is a social activity, and children’s reading occurs in specific social contexts,and can be influenced by key social agents such as parents. Recent international researchsuggests that the majority of those who identify as avid readers in adulthood have had aperson exert “a significant positive influence on their attitude toward reading books” (Merga,2017b), with maternal and paternal figures predominantly featured as key social influences.We found that “when respondents were exposed to a love of reading, whether it be throughobservation of a loved or respected figure, a social influence taking the time to activelyprovide access or support choice, or through social interaction and shared enjoyment, a life-long reader could be fostered” (Merga, 2017b).While we draw from a variety of research sources to explore the role of parents infostering young people’s enjoyment of independent and shared book reading beyond theearly years, we make most frequent reference to the mixed methods 2016 WASCBR. Thisstudy collected survey data from 997 children aged 8-12 at 24 schools in Western Australia.It was granted institutional and state departmental ethics approvals and rigorously piloted at alocal school prior to implementation, with minor changes made to the tools. Data werecollected in a visit to each school by Margaret (Chief Investigator). All consentingparticipants in Grades 4 and 6 took part in the survey, with two children randomly selectedfrom each school to participate in the interviews, controlled only for gender. The qualitativedata were principally analyzed using the constant comparative method (Holton, 2011), withquantitative data analyzed using an array of techniques responsive to the research questions.These data provide current insights into this area of interest.Children’s reading engagement7By the time children reach third grade, most are expected to have attained independentreading skill, with high stakes testing requiring independent reading ability often beginningaround this age. While literacy skills are expected to increase during the schooling years,research suggests that children’s engagement in reading declines over this period. RecentScholastic (2015; 2017) research found that in the US and Australia, children read less oftenas they age, reflective of previous reports that reading for pleasure significantly declines aschildren move through the years of schooling (Dickenson, 2014).Due to the wide range of aforementioned benefits conferred by reading, both the agerelated and longitudinal general declines are serious issues that need to be confronted by bothparents and educators to ensure that children develop lifelong reading habits. We need tocommunicate an expectation that children continue to read, and we need to provide supportand encouragement to facilitate this reading.Encouragement to read from parents and othersGiven what we know about the relationship between reading encouragement and children’sattitudes toward reading, it is important to gauge the levels of encouragement that childrenreceive to read beyond the early years. Our research suggests that children do not necessarilyreceive strong encouragement to read. When children aged 8 to 12 were asked “Doessomeone you know encourage you to read?” as part of the WASCBR survey, nearly a third ofrespondents selected “no” (Merga & Mat Roni, 2018). While age is negatively associatedwith reading encouragement, more than half (54.5%) of these “no” respondents were nineyears old or younger, suggesting that even relatively young children are not necessarilyreceiving encouragement to continue to read.Gender can play a role in how parents apportion time for reading encouragement,with recent research suggesting that parents are more likely to spend time reading with younggirls than their male counterparts (Baker & Milligan, 2016). We found that girls receive more8encouragement to read than boys, even though boys tend to read with less frequency (Merga& Mat Roni, 2018). As boys tend to read less often than girls, providing girls with moreencouragement to read than boys can perpetuate the gender gap in reading frequency, whichin turn can re-inforce the inequity in literacy scores between boys and girls which has beenbroadly recognized internationally.As children move through the years of schooling, in many cases, reading becomes anorphaned responsibility, whereby parents may assume it is the role of the teachers, andteachers may assume it is the role of the parents to provide continued encouragement in thisarea (e.g. Bunbury, 1995). However, just as teachers cannot realistically expect that allparents are sufficiently knowledgeable, willing and able to provide this encouragement athome, parents cannot safely assume that schools are carrying full responsibility forencouraging children to read beyond the early years in light of competing and extensivecurricular demands (Merga, 2015). In addition, not all teachers are viewed as reading modelsby young children (Merga, 2016), so ideally parents should strive to be reading models wherepossible.After independent reading skill acquisition, parents may become a less potentencouraging force in children’s lives. While there are little longitudinal data capturing thesechanges over time, when we asked adolescent students about their reflections on changinglevels of parental support, we found that “for many students, once the skill to read wasacquired, parental encouragement also dwindled”, which we characterized as “expiredexpectations” (Merga, 2014, p. 153). We feel that expired expectations are likely to be atleast in part a product of poor understanding of the continue importance of reading beyondthe period of independent reading skill acquisition.Our research also found that children were often keenly aware of parental hypocrisy,which affected their reception of encouragement from their parents, highlighting the9importance of parents’ modeling keen reading practices. For instance, one child commentedthat “even though my dad doesn’t like reading books, he still wants me to read books”(Merga & Mat Roni, 2018). When parents expected their children to read, but did not readthemselves, children were sensitive to this contradiction.Adolescents’ retrospective reflections on parental encouragement has also given usconsiderable insight into which encouragement approaches are well received by youngpeople. We found that while being responsive to children’s unique taste and preferences andactively “modelling keen reading, providing informed recommendations for their children,and facilitating access to books” were all well-regarded forms of encouragement, “parentswho make academic improvement the basis of encouraging reading may be compromisingtheir ability to encourage the enjoyment of this leisure activity” (Merga, 2014, p. 161).Encouragement aimed at fostering enjoyment and shared social purpose is more successfulthat encouragement purely focusses on academic attainment.That many children in upper primary school were unsure if their teachers likedreading, but were sure than they valued it for testing purposes (Merga, 2016), suggests thatschools can inadvertently stress reading for testing rather than reading for pleasure in thecurrent high-stakes testing environment, increasing the importance that parents provide amore balanced view toward reading in home.Children’s attitudes toward shared reading beyond early childhoodWhile parents can influence their children’s independent book reading, they may also exertinfluence through shared reading. Research suggests that both independent and sharedreading experiences offer benefits for children, and shared reading also retains significantvalue beyond the initial phase of independent reading acquisition. Shared reading enablesgreater language exposure, fostering the development of receptive language (Senechal &LeFevre, 2002). It has also been found to enhance spelling (Mol & Bus, 2011) and10vocabulary acquisition (Farrant & Zubrick, 2012). Reading aloud offers powerful cognitivebenefits, activating brain areas related to mental imagery and reading comprehension (Huttonet al., 2015). Shared reading remains beneficial beyond the stage of independent reading skillacquisition, as older children and even adults can benefit from shared reading opportunities.Shared reading should not cease just because children are competent independentreaders, as some children strongly regret early cessation. More than a third of Australianrespondents aged 6 to 11 whose parents had stopped reading to them wanted it to continue(Scholastic, 2015, p. 30). When describing the curtailment of this practice in his life, one boyexplained, “they kind of stopped when I knew how to read.  I knew how to read, but I juststill liked my mum reading it to me (sic)” (Merga, 2017a). Recent US research suggests thatparental reading aloud at home decreases significantly as children move through the years ofschooling; while 59% of parents read to their children aged five years or less, only 38% readto their children aged six to eight years, and only 17% read to children aged nine to eleven(Scholastic, 2017). When investigating shared reading beyond the early years, decisionsaround cessation may be responsive to both parental and child attitudes and ideas about thevalue of reading beyond this point. As such, parents’ attitudes can influence those of theirchildren, and the reverse (Baker, Scher & Mackler, 1997), so cessation cannot always besimplistically attributed to either parent or child.When children were interviewed about their experiences of shared reading beyond theearly years, we found that quality emerged as an issue. The quality of the experience can beinfluenced by the time and environment in which it is conducted. The reading experiencecould be detrimentally impacted when haphazardly inserted into part of a busy domesticschedule, where a child may find themselves reading aloud to the back of a parent who wasbusy cooking, cleaning or caring for other children (Merga, 2017a).11A poor-quality experience, in which parents and children plough through withoutinterpersonal connection, or in which children are repetitively and relentlessly corrected forevery minor error, may actually inhibit the fostering of a life-long reading habit in children,due to its potential to associate reading with stress and assessment, rather than enjoyment andengagement. We suggest that “whether at home or at school, interactive reading experiencesare about more than completion of a set task; social interaction and nurturance during thistime are also invaluable, and play a key role in establishing positive attitudes toward reading,which are essential for encouraging life-long reading, and also beneficial to facilitate skillacquisition” (Merga, 2017a).However, we also understand that contemporary life is full of challenges, and thatmany parents, particularly those who have to work extended hours to ensure economicsufficiency, simply would not be able to find time to read to their children. This is a timeavailability issue which can genuinely be insurmountable. However, where this is a timeallocation issue, parents may wish to reconsider their priorities to ensure that their childrenexperience optimal literacy advantages.A range of other genuine barriers may influence parents’ ability to participate inshared reading, such as low parental literacy and health problems. While low literacy canpose a notable barrier to parents’ capacity to read aloud to their children, children appreciatethe efforts of their parents, even when the reading aloud experience lacks competence andfluidity. Where we have collected data about adults’ reflections on being read to as children,parental effort even where there was low reading aloud competence powerfullycommunicated a valuing of reading which was motivating in itself.For example, a respondent described how her mother, who struggled with dyslexia,nevertheless read to her to the best of her ability, and how this inculcated a life-long love ofreading in her (Merga, 2017b). Similarly, a respondent described her mother being a poor12reader compared to her father, however the opportunity for closeness and shared experienceduring shared reading meant that the experience was still highly valued (Merga & Ledger, inpress). Some parents found novel ways to work around their own literacy barriers, such aslistening to audiobooks with their children. As such, while we recognise that low literacy andreading disorders will pose a significant barrier, the barrier is not necessarily immutable.Parents may persist, finding ways to mitigate these issues; further research that goes beyondidentifying barriers to participation, to focus on how to mitigate these barriers, is needed.While a few children were pleased when shared reading was ceased, as they werefrustrated by the reading aloud experience with the parents as they desired to readautonomously, many more regretted the end of this opportunity. Although some childrenrelated this cessation to a perceived disadvantage for language acquisition and readingpractice, others were more concerned about the loss of valuable social time with their parents(Merga, 2017a). Parents also value this social time; most parents in a recent study who readto their children enjoyed doing so, and when asked why they did, reasons tended to relate toenjoyment, interpersonal connection, and recognition of the learning opportunity (Merga &Ledger, in press).Mothers and fathers as reading modelsWe would also like to share new insights into the role that mothers and fathers can play inmodelling positive attitudes toward reading for their children.  As part of the WASCBR, wecollected data around children’s perception of their parents as reading models which wereport on here.Most of the children who took part in our study felt that at least one person in theirfamily liked reading. A strong 93.4% of children felt that this was the case. Students whoanswered “yes” on this survey item were then asked “who in your family likes readingbooks?”, and permitted multiple selections. The responses can be seen in Table 1 below.13[Insert Table 1.]As per Table 1, mothers are far more likely to be modelling positive attitudes thanfathers. This is reflective of earlier research which suggests that the intergenerationaltransmission may be perceived as a maternal role, which in turn transmits the notion thatreading is a feminine activity (e.g. Morgan, Nutbrown, & Hannon, 2009). While some fathersare doing an excellent job of modelling positive reading behaviours for their children, it ismothers who are most likely to be perceived as reading models. We are aware that thesefindings are significantly constrained by solo parent and other emergent non-traditionalfamily forms, and these qualifications need to be taken into account when considering ourfindings. This pattern was further observed in the interviews, with mothers more frequentlydescribed as reading models than fathers.We also wanted to know which attitudes and behaviours were perceived by childrenas evidence that reading was enjoyed, or not enjoyed by their parent(s), to determine how aparental reading model was perceived. We asked children if their parents read, and how theirparents felt about reading books, in order to explore their perception. We found that childrenwere generally quite highly observant, and most did not hesitate to give a clear description oftheir perception of their parents as readers. We subjected these data to iterative thematiccoding to analyse key trends.Children commented about their parents’ reading routines, reading volume andfrequency. For example, when asked about her mother’s reading, Samara explained that“she’s always looking for a book that she can read. She always looks for audio books so thatshe can listen to them while she’s driving. And then she always finishing books and shealways has a book that she’s started reading”. Many children were aware of their parents’daily and nightly reading habits, and they felt that being able to see a parental reading routineestablished them as a keen reader.14In some cases, some parents liked to openly share their love of books, by telling theirchildren about their reading, and parental reading was perceived to be the preferred form ofrecreational activity. For instance, Luke explained that his mother would read “whenever mydad’s not nagging at her to do stuff”, and Sarah described her mother’s love of reading aslimited her ability to meet her domestic work:…she loves to read, she sometimes bans herself from reading ‘cos she won’t do anyof the washing, or doing anything like that. Like last night when we were meant to begetting ready for camping, she got a book and started reading outside, and got told offfrom Dad.Sarah’s mother’s attempts at self-regulation around reading were duly noted by her daughter,who was herself a daily reader. Demonstrating a preference for reading above other possibleactivities was keenly perceived to indicate a love of reading.Similarly, children discussed negative attitudes toward reading, and fathers wereoverrepresented in this discussion. For instance, Marco explained that “I’ve never seen himread in my life”. Other children characterized reading as outside the acceptable identity orpractices that their father would engage in. For example, when explaining why she felt thather Dad did not like reading, Justine explained that “my dad’s more like, I’m going to go andbuild something or something because my dad’s like, all building and stuff like me”, whereasJason’s father was felt to be “not really a reading person; he’s mainly a math person”, andNaomi’s father was “more of like, a TV person, watch football, my mum’s more of a readingperson”. Children often made excuses for their parents, explaining that they felt that workcommitments prevented them from reading. As per Table 1 above, mothers were typicallymore likely to be seen as reading models, and while children were not asked to compare theirparents as readers, they sometimes did during the interviews, tending to view their mothers as15a more avid reader. Being a reader was deemed outside the paternal reading identity in manycases, with reading seen by children as more than an activity, rather, as part of a personality.Concluding commentsThere is much that parents can do to in order to foster a love of reading in their childrenbeyond the early years, and teachers can play a powerful role in sharing this knowledge andskill base. While both independent and shared reading are highly beneficial practices,independent reading is in decline and parents may curtail shared reading experiencesprematurely. Not all young people are receiving encouragement to read independently, whichcan inadvertently communicate to them that reading is no longer important or necessary. Inaddition to sharing reading with their children for as long as possible, parents who effectivelysupport young people’s reading beyond early childhood tend to know their children’spreferences, model positive reading engagement, recommend books to their children, andhelp them to access books.Children tend to appreciate shared reading experiences with their parents, and can bedisappointed when there are perceived to be curtailed while they are still valued. However,the quality of the experience can be highly variable, underscoring the importance ofremembering that this activity is a social exchange which fosters enjoyment in order toinfluence attitudes toward reading, as well as support skill acquisition.A continual demonstration of habitual reading by the parents can form a long-lastingimpression for the children to imitate as they progress in their lives. While most childrenwere exposed to a positive reading model in the home, 78% of mothers and 55.6% of fatherswere seen to enjoy reading.Where possible, fathers could take increasing responsibility to model positive readingengagement, and show that reading part of an acceptable masculine identity. Ideally, Dadscan be a “reading person” too.16While this paper focusses on the value of reading encouragement as valuable forfostering reading engagement in children, we have also highlighted some of the many waysthat encouragement can be demonstrated. Children benefit from:•  talking about books and sharing book recommendations with their parents,keeping reading for pleasure in focus rather than academic testing•  having access to books in the home•  sharing quality reading aloud experiences with their parents•  having parents or guardians who actively model a love of reading, and expecttheir children to devote some regular time to readingThe supportive strategies highlighted above need not be deemed exclusively the roleof parents; teachers can also enact all of these strategies. In addition, as reading expert,teachers can make the most of their position to support parents to effectively encouragecontinued engagement in reading beyond the early years. As we contend elsewhere, “teachersmay have the greater responsibility, as parents may face additional challenges such as lowliteracy, or other issues such as high workloads leading to high home absenteeism, or healthconditions that impact upon their capacity to support intergenerational transmission ofliteracy” (Merga, 2017a, p. 12). Schools need to work more collaboratively with familiesfrom all backgrounds, as children’s disengagement from reading cannot be situated as anissue to be purely dealt with in the domestic space, and as previously contended, fosteringreading engagement is a shared job in which teachers can play a vital supporting role. Wewould particularly like to suggest that teachers and schools avoid transmitting messagesabout reading that locate the practice solely with testing, so that the activity is not perceivedas divorced from pleasure, and as we have outlined, there is educative benefit in keepingpleasure in focus.17Take Action!1. Let your parents know that it is important that they continue to encourage theirchildren to read independently right up until adulthood, reading aloud with them untilthey no longer wish to do so.2. Low parental literacy does not have to be an immutable barrier to shared reading;listening to audiobooks with your child is one possible way to maintain a sharedreading experience with them.3. Provide access to books in the home either through classroom libraries, schoollibraries or a local library.4. Highlight the importance of to making time to share the experience in a comfortable,calm atmosphere. You may also need to model how to read with a child, as not allparents will have experienced this when they were children.5. Suggest that parents find out what kinds of books their children like to read; this canalso be done in class, with findings sent home e.g. a poster about the books I like6. Encourage parents to talk about the books that they read with their children, and makerecommendations where appropriate. Where parents are not able to read, they can stillask their children about the books they enjoyed.7. Encourage parents to be seen to be a reading person where possible; when parentsmodel positive attitudes toward reading, their children are the beneficiaries.18ReferencesBaer, J., Baldi, S., Ayotte, K., & Green, P.
