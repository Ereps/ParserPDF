School of Health Sciences, Health Campus Universiti Sains Malaysia, 16150 Kubang Kerian,Kelantan.Correspondence to Sabreena Safuan (sabreena@usm.my)HighlightMalaysia has recorded the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia with more than35% of new COVID-19 cases linked to the Sri Petaling gathering, a Moslem missionarymovement attended by more than 19000 people of different nationalities, in March 2020 inKuala Lumpur. From this cluster, 1701 samples have been tested positive out of 21920 testscarried out. Thus, mass gathering during COVID-19 pandemic period should be banned to curbdisease transmission.© International Society of Travel Medicine 2020. All rights reserved.

Hence, mass gatherings are a riskfactor for rapid spread of COVID-19.Malaysia has recorded the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia (4817cases and 77 deaths as of 13th April 2020) (Figure 1). The first case was reported on 25th January2020 involving 3 Chinese-national from Wuhan who entered Malaysia on 23rd January 2020from Singapore. Since then, positive cases gradually increase to 22 on 15th February 2020 whichremain plateau for nearly 2 weeks. It seems that the containment measures (contact tracing andisolation) practiced at that time were effective to prevent disease spread. However, several newcases were reported from 28th February to 14th March 2020 and the number increased to morethan 4000 cases by 1st April 2020 2.More than 35% of the COVID cases in Malaysia are directly linked to the Sri Petalingmass gathering that took place on 27th February 2020 to 1st March 2020. The Sri Petalinggathering is a Moslem missionary movement attended by more than 19000 people, including1500 from India, South Korea, Brunei, China, Japan and Thailand3. This religious gatheringinvolved follower of Tabligh, the largest Islamic missionary group with the aim to urge Moslemsto practice Islam by following Prophet Muhammad’s way of life, in its perfection. Part of thisDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jtm/taaa059/5822105 by guest on 20 April 2020UNCORRECTED MANUSCRIPT3movement involved an annual gathering of Tablighi from all around the world, in whichparticipating countries took turn to organize this event. Tablighi gathering involved the sharingof communal space such as prayer hall during congregational prayers and sermons, collectiveeating from one plate and sharing of sleeping area.The Sri Petaling participants were urged to come forward to the nearest Ministry ofHealth (MoH) facility in order to be tested. The plead to come forward was made in official pressconferences and social medias. Those who did not come for the test were traced based on theiraddresses. Health Ministry of Malaysia was working together with the police to ensure that allparticipants be tested immediately even though they are not showing any symptoms. As on 13thApril 2020, 19032 tests were conducted from a total of 21,920 samples taken. From thesesamples, 1701 samples were positive. This contributes 35% from the total number of COVID-19cases, the biggest cluster so far in Malaysia.The Sri Petaling event became the catalysis for the subsequent spread of COVID-19 inMalaysia. Rapid identification and isolation of cases as well as contact tracing is logistically verychallenging in the context of such a mass gathering with many participants returning to theircountries of origin. In response, the government enforced movement control order under thePrevention and Control of Infectious Disease Act 1988 and the Police Act 1967 as a mitigationstrategy to prevent COVID-19 starting from 18th to 31st March 2020. In this phase, socialdistancing was adopted by closing of all government and private premises (except those inessential services) including all kindergartens, schools and institutions of higher learning. Themovement control order also includes prohibition of mass movements and gatherings regardlessof the purpose. The obligatory Friday prayer was also suspended and replaced by Zohor prayer(daily midday prayer) at home.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jtm/taaa059/5822105 by guest on 20 April 2020UNCORRECTED MANUSCRIPT4However, the lag time between the Sri Petaling gathering and movement restrictions andsocial distancing allowed further spread of COVID-19 (Figure 2).  As the attendees of SriPetaling gathering had returned to their respective hometowns in other parts of Malaysia,attended their local mosques for mass prayer and participated in various other culturalceremonies, second generations of COVID-19 cases started to sprout linked to the Sri Petalinggathering. One of the sub-cluster is in Simpang Renggam, Kluang Johor in South Malaysiawhere a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases was reported after 15 March 2020.2  The two mainareas in Simpang Renggam that were affected were due to religious classes and a weddingreception attended by participants from the Sri Petaling gathering as they were not compliant toisolation and quarantine measures. Since then, more than 200 positive cases of COVID-19 werereported from Simpang Renggam. Subsequently, the Malaysian government enforced EnhancedMovement Control Order (EMCO) to the two areas in Simpang Renggam effective from 27thMarch 2020.4 Throughout this period, residents were ordered to stay at home while visitors werenot allowed to enter the quarantined areas. All entry and exit points were monitored by theArmed Forced and Civil Defense Force to ensure 100% compliance. Basic necessities such asfood and medicine were supplied by the Malaysian government until the EMCO was lifted on14th April 2020. In addition, phase 2 of the movement control order was announced to the rest ofthe country effective 1st April until 14th April 2020 to curb further transmission. Phase 2 involvedtighter implementations in which essential services such as supermarkets, petrol stations andeateries were only allowed to operate within a restricted time. Failure to comply can result inimprisonment and fine.Sri Petaling gathering have also cause regional spike of COVID-19 cases acrossSoutheast Asia. Nearly 10% of attendees were overseas participants from Brunei, Thailand,Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jtm/taaa059/5822105 by guest on 20 April 2020UNCORRECTED MANUSCRIPT5Cambodia, Vietnam, the Phillipines and Indonesia. In fact, there were also participants fromChina and South Korea. When these overseas participants returned to their respective countries,cases linked to this gathering were reported across Southeast Asia (Figure 3). Many participants,unaware that they have contacted the virus from the Sri Petaling gathering, did not practice socialdistancing and 14 days recommended isolation upon returning to their hometown. In Brunei forexample, two participants from Sri Petaling was the country’s first positive COVID-19 casebefore the figure jumped to 136 as off 14th April 2020. Similarly, 13 Indonesians and 19 Filipinoshave also contacted COVID-19 virus from their involvement in the Sri Petaling gathering. Othercountries affected were shown in Figure 3.Malaysia is not alone in announcing the prohibition of religious mass gatherings.Increasingly, evidence is mounting that mass gatherings have led to further spread. Effective 27thFebruary 2020, the Saudi government has suspended Umrah visa in their effort to break the chainof transmission of COVID-19 5 Based on our experience, we recommend that mass gatherings,be it for religious or other purposes, should be cancelled and banned throughout the period of theCOVID pandemic.FundingThis work was supported by Incentive Grant Universiti Sains Malaysia (Grant number:1001/PPSK/8123055)Authors StatementsNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jtm/taaa059/5822105 by guest on 20 April 2020UNCORRECTED MANUSCRIPT6Authors ContributionsNFCM, HAE conceived the idea and wrote the manuscript.
