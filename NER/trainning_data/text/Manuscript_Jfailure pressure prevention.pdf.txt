The main goal is to propose a methodology with accounting for the pipe extremities (axial stress) in an analysis to predict an accurate failure pressure. The proposed methodology defines a simple expression for a real test specimen condition (closed cap cylinder), which allows to estimate the failure pressure using the elastic properties of the materials and test specimen geometry. Hydrostatic tests performed in different laboratories are used to validate the proposed methodology. The results show a good agreement between the model prediction and the experimental failure pressure results in all cases. However, a careful selection of the remaining strength factor is needed, as it impacts on the accuracy and conservative level of the failure pressure. In addition to the axial stress, there is a possibility to refine the theoretical prediction of the failure pressure value by accounting for the plastic deformation far from the defect region as well as the radial stress in the failure analysis.

Introduction In recent years, it has been observed a rapid growth of the use of polymeric composite materials to repair metallic and non-metallic structures in the aerospace, sports, construction, petroleum and oil industry [1-2]. The fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) matrix composite repair system is widely used for metallic pipelines in offshore and onshore units as it offers many advantages such as: corrosion prevention, quick repair, cold work, safety and it is more economical etc. over a conventional welding repair method [3-7]. An assessment of a composite repair system for corroded pipelines is in progress and many researchers carried out hydrostatic testing of metallic pipelines reinforced with composites to assure the structural integrity [8-13]. Generally, hydrostatic tests are performed according to the ASME PCC-2 [14] and ISO/TS 24817 [15] composite repair standards. Still, there is a continuous modification of the standard over a theoretical failure pressure prediction with the input from the research studies [16-21]. Several theoretical models have been proposed on corroded pipelines reinforced with a polymer based composite repair system under certain assumptions and were also validated with the hydrostatic test results [22-26]. Many proposed models predicted a reasonably accurate failure pressure but still there is a difference between the theoretical and the experimental failure pressures. This difference is caused by many assumptions while deriving the expression, such as, neglecting axial and radial stresses and not accounting for the plastic deformation far away from the defect region. These assumptions help to derive a simple expression to predict the failure pressure using only the elastic properties of the materials but at the cost of low accuracy. Besides the composite material properties, the fiber orientation, stacking sequence, fiber placement, repair thickness, lay-up angle, material behavior model are the important parameters for a pipe, where the stresses are generated along circumferential and axial directions [27-29]. A sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the effect of these parameters and optimize the composite system for better performance and reliability of the composite structure also studied [27, 28]. Many authors [22-24, 30] suggested to account for these assumptions for a more accurate prediction of the failure pressure but still have not accounted for it in the analysis, because of the complexity in the analytical expressions. In addition to these assumptions, the remaining strength and flow stress parameters are the possible causes for the difference in the theoretical and experimental failure pressures, which varies as per selection criterion. There are many available criteria listed in the literature and the most commonly used criteria are ASME B31G, RSTENG 0.85, DNV and their modified 4  version along with Ritchie and last, RC/Battelle, Chell, Sims, Kanninem and Chell [17, 31- 36].  The Failure analysis of corroded metallic pipelines reinforced with a polymer based composite repair system is well developed but considered only the circumferential stress and neglected the axial and radial stresses [17]. The axial stress is neglected due to the fact that the real pipeline is open at both ends and is very long, however hydrostatic tests are usually performed taking as cylindrical specimen closed at both ends. In the present work the problem is modelled in the context of elasto-plasticity as a thin-walled cylinder closed at the extremities (axial stress) to predict an accurate failure pressure. The material behavior is assumed to be elastic far from the defect region. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, the failure pressures obtained in a series of hydrostatic tests of pipes are compared with the theoretical failure pressure [4, 20, 24, 25]. Furthermore, the failure pressure is calculated by using different criteria and compared with the experimental results, in order to find the best criterion to be used based on the requirement of accuracy and conservative level.  2. Thin-walled elastic-plastic pipe under internal pressure The aim of this study is to propose a theoretical analysis constrained to thin-walled metallic pipes and considering a set of elastic-plastic constitutive equations to predict failure pressure. The idea is to obtain an analytical expression which can account for a more practical condition such as the pipe specimen extremities, variation of the thickness and localized plastic deformation in order to predict a more accurate failure pressure. It is considered an elasto-plastic cylinder with internal radius ( 𝑟𝑖), pipe thickness (𝑒), subjected to an internal pressure ( 𝑃𝑖) (Fig. 1).  𝒓𝒊 𝒆 > 10   Thin-wall cylinder condition                         (1) 5   Fig. 1. Pipe with internal pressure.  The stress component of the thin-walled cylinder in the cylindrical co-ordinate system (r-θ-z) is as shown below: 𝜎 = [ 𝜎𝑟 0 0 0 𝜎𝜃 0 0 0 𝜎𝑧 ]                                  (2) Where, 𝜎𝑟, 𝜎𝜃 and 𝜎𝑧 are the radial, circumferential and axial stress components of the cylinder, while the shear stresses 𝜏𝑟𝜃, 𝜏𝜃𝑧 and 𝜏𝑟𝑧 are neglected as they are relatively negligible compared to the normal stress components. Considering a thin-walled isotropic cylinder and that the radial stress along the radial direction is constant (𝜎𝑟 = 0), equation (2) becomes: 𝜎 = [ 𝜎𝑟 = 0 0 0 0 𝜎𝜃 0 0 0 𝜎𝑧 = 𝜎𝜃/2 ]  for a closed cap cylinder (𝜎𝑧 ≠ 0)                    (3) 𝜎 = [ 𝜎𝑟 = 0 0 0 0 𝜎𝜃 0 0 0 𝜎𝑧 = 0 ]   for an open cap cylinder (𝜎𝑧 = 0)                     (4) With, 𝜎𝜃 = 𝑃𝑟𝑖 𝑒   and 𝜎𝑧 = 𝜎𝜃 2 = 𝑃𝑟𝑖 2𝑒                               (5) Generally, the axial stress is assumed to be negligible for long pipes but it becomes influential when closed on both sides during a hydrostatic test. The axial stress in a closed pipe is almost half of the circumferential stress, so both stress components are dependent (𝜎𝑧 = 𝜎𝜃 2 ) to each other. 6  Considering the plastic deformation behavior of the pipe, the tangential stress becomes: 𝜎𝜃 = 𝜎𝑦 + 𝐾(𝜀𝜃 𝑝) 𝑁if    𝜎𝜃 > 𝜎𝑦                              (6) Where, 𝜎𝑦 is the yielding stress, K and N are the positive material constants that characterize the plastic behavior of the material. If, 𝜎𝜃 < 𝜎𝑦 it means no plastic deformation occurs, 𝜀𝜃 𝑝=0. The total strain of the pipe material is as follows: 𝜀𝜃 = 𝜀𝜃 𝑒 + 𝜀𝜃 𝑝 = 𝜎𝜃 𝐸 + 𝜀𝜃 𝑝                                (7) Assuming that, 𝜀𝜃 ≈ 𝑢𝑟 𝑟𝑖 The radial displacement can be obtained through equation (8): 𝑢𝑟 𝑟𝑖 = 𝜎𝜃 𝐸 + ( 𝜎𝜃−𝜎𝑦 𝐾 ) 1/𝑁 (8) The radial displacement 𝑢𝑟 for the elastic-plastic behavior can be expressed as: 𝑢𝑟 = 𝑟𝑖 [ 𝜎𝜃 𝐸 + ( 𝜎𝜃−𝜎𝑦 𝐾 ) 1/𝑁 ]                                (9) While, the radial displacement for the elastic behavior can be expressed as: 𝑢𝑟 = 𝑟𝑖 ( 𝜎𝜃 𝐸 )                                 (10) There are two classical yield failure criteria: the Tresca criterion and the von Mises criterion which are used extensively in structural stresses and deformation analysis. In this study, the von Mises failure criterion is used to predict the theoretical failure pressure with accounting for the circumferential and axial stresses. The Principal stresses σ1 (σz), σ2 (σθ) and σ3 (σr) are acting on the thin walled cylinder subjected to internal pressure as shown in Fig. 2.  Fig. 2. Principal stresses on thin pressurized cylinder with closed end caps. 7  As per the definition of the von Mises yield failure criterion, the general form of the von Mises failure criterion in terms of principal stresses is: 1 √2 [(𝜎1 − 𝜎2)2 + (𝜎2 − 𝜎3)2 + (𝜎3 − 𝜎1)2]1/2 = 𝜎𝑦                      (11) The plane stress (thin cylinder), 𝜎3 (𝜎𝑟) = 0, therefore, the von Mises criterion for cylindrical coordinates (r-θ-z), assuming that the radial stress is zero, 𝜎𝑟 = 0, yields equation (12): [(𝜎𝜃)2 − (𝜎𝜃𝜎𝑧) + (𝜎𝑧)2]1/2 = 𝜎𝑦                           (12) The above equation is valid, if the pipe is closed, which confirms the presence of an axial stress term in the analysis, otherwise for the open ended cylinder condition (𝜎𝑧 = 0), equation (12) reduces to: 𝜎𝜃 = 𝜎𝑦                                  (13) This form is the most used as it is simple and easy to formulate the mathematical expression for the failure pressure of a damaged pipe and it gives a more conservative failure value as it considers only the circumferential stress. The internal failure pressure for the cylinder with elastic behavior is: 𝜎𝜃 = 𝜎𝑦 = 𝑃𝑟𝑖 𝑒                                       (14) 𝑃 = (𝑒𝜎𝑦) 𝑟𝑖                                                  (15) The maximum theoretical failure pressure can be related to the ultimate stress, 𝜎𝑢𝑙𝑡, as it was explained in [22, 23]. 𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑡ℎ = (𝑒∗𝜎𝑢𝑙𝑡) 𝑟𝑖                                 (16) 3. Remaining strength criteria for wall loss defects (𝛼𝜃) The wall loss defect in metallic pipes is taken into account by the remaining strength factor (damage factor). This factor (𝛼𝜃) is a function of defect and pipe geometry and varies according to the selection criteria. All these criteria can be expressed as follows: 𝜎𝜃 = 𝛼𝜃 ( 𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖 𝑒 ) 𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑑                                 (17)  8  The maximum theoretical failure pressure of the wall loss defect of a metallic pipeline can be determined as: 𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑡ℎ = 𝑒 𝛼𝜃𝑟𝑖 𝜎𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤                                   (18) Where, 𝛼𝜃 is the damage factor and 𝜎𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 is the maximum allowable strength before failure, both parameters vary according to the criterion. ASME B31G and RSTRENG 0.85 criteria are the most widely used for corroded pipelines subjected to an internal pressure [17, 32-35]. The difference between the many criteria is the option of the flow stress and the expression for the remaining strength factor, so careful selection of criterion is needed. The remaining strength factor and flow stress formulae of ASME B31G, RSTRENG and DNV and the modified version of each criterion are listed in Table. 1. The most widely used criteria are ASME B31G, RSTRENG 0.85 and DNV and their modified version, as these criteria predict a more accurate failure pressure than other criteria [17, 24, 25].

Proposed methodology for failure pressure analysis of composite repair system The present section is concerned with the analysis of composite sleeve reinforcement systems for metallic pipelines, which accounts for a practical condition such as pipe specimen extremities (closed cap cylinder) for predicting a more accurate failure pressure. The basic assumption is that the wall loss defect is localized and thus the stress and strain fields far from the defect are not subjected to plastic deformation. As a consequence, the material behavior is assumed to be elastic far from the defect. The behavior of steel pipe at defect section is idealized an elastic-perfectly plastic (without strain hardening of steel). The pipe-composite sleeve system is modelled as two concentric thin-walled cylinders subjected to an internal pressure Pi and contact pressure Pc between the pipe and composite sleeve (Fig. 3). The pipe has an inner radius ri   and external diameter D with defect length L and depth d, while the composite sleeve has an internal radius ro and external radius re (Fig. 4).   Fig. 3. Pipe and sleeve with internal and contact pressure.  If the wall thickness of a pipe epipe is less than 1/10th of the internal radius of the cylinder, epipe=(ro-ri)<(ri/10), then the cylinder wall is considered thin, otherwise, it is considered thick [31]. Similarly for the composite sleeve, esleeve=(re-ro)<(ro/10).   10   Fig. 4. Metal loss in the pipe with a composite reinforcement sleeve. Table 2 Hydrostatic burst test data.

Assuming that the radial displacement in the contact surface is the same for both cylinders, it is possible to obtain analytical expressions for the stress, strain and displacement fields. The contact surface between the pipe and the composite sleeve can be approximated using the following relation and correlate with the initial pressure. [Radial displacement] pipe = [Radial displacement] sleeve [𝑢𝑟]𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒 = [𝑢𝑟]𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑣𝑒                               (19) 𝑟𝑖[𝜀𝜃]𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒 = 𝑟𝑜[𝜀𝜃]𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑣𝑒                              (20) 𝑟𝑖 [𝜎𝜃]𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒 𝐸𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒 = 𝑟𝑜 [𝜎𝜃]𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑣𝑒 𝐸𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑣𝑒                               (21) 𝑟𝑖 𝐸𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒 ( 𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜 𝑟𝑜−𝑟𝑖 ) = 𝑟𝑜 𝐸𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑣𝑒 ( 𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜 𝑟𝑒−𝑟𝑜)                            (22) The contact pressure, 𝑃𝑐, acting between the pipe and the composite sleeve (Fig. 4) can be approximated in terms of internal pressure using the following relation: 𝑃𝑐 = 𝑃𝑖 [ (𝑟0−𝑟𝑖) (𝑟𝑒−𝑟𝑜) ( 𝐸𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒 𝐸𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑣𝑒) ( 𝑟0 𝑟𝑖) 2 + ( 𝑟0 𝑟𝑖)] −1 = 𝛽𝑃𝑖                        (23)  If the composite repair thickness (esleeve) is higher than 1/10th of the external radius of the steel tube ro then, the sleeve’s radial displacement cannot be assumed constant. In this case, the equations 19, 22, and 23 becomes: [𝑢𝑟]𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒 = [𝑢𝑟 (𝑟 = 𝑟𝑜)]𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑣𝑒                            (24) 𝑟𝑖 𝐸𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒 ( 𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜 𝑟0−𝑟𝑖 ) = −𝐵𝑃𝑐𝐾𝑟𝑜 −𝑘 ( 1 𝐸𝜃𝜃 + 𝜈𝑟𝜃 𝐸𝑟𝑟) + 𝐶𝑃𝑐𝐾𝑟𝑜 𝑘 ( 1 𝐸𝜃𝜃 − 𝜈𝑟𝜃 𝐸𝑟𝑟)                   (25) 𝑃𝑐 = 𝑟𝑖 2 𝐸𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒(𝑟𝑖−𝑟𝑜) −𝐵𝐾𝑟𝑜−𝑘( 1 𝐸𝜃𝜃+ 𝜈𝑟𝜃 𝐸𝑟𝑟)+𝐶𝐾𝑟𝑜𝑘( 1 𝐸𝜃𝜃− 𝜈𝑟𝜃 𝐸𝑟𝑟)+ 𝑟𝑖 𝑟𝑜 𝐸𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒(𝑟𝑖−𝑟𝑜) 𝑃𝑖 = 𝛽𝑃𝑖                     (26) Where, 𝐾 = √ Eθ Er,𝐵 = ( 𝑟𝑒𝐾−1 [𝑟𝑜 −(𝐾+1)𝑟𝑒 (𝐾−1)− 𝑟𝑜 (𝐾+1)𝑟𝑒 −(𝐾−1)]), 𝐶 = ( 𝑟𝑒 −(𝐾−1) [𝑟𝑜 −(𝐾+1)𝑟𝑒 (𝐾−1)− 𝑟𝑜 (𝐾+1)𝑟𝑒 −(𝐾−1)]) Let us consider the axial stress component (test pipe extremities) in the failure pressure analysis that is not accounted in previous studies. Usually, the hydrostatic tests are performed considering a cylindrical specimen closed at the both ends using a welded cap or a bolted pressure flange. However, in reality, the pipeline is not closed, therefore, the effect of axial stresses in the longitudinal direction is almost negligible. In the present analysis the problem is modelled in the context of elasto-plasticity as a thin-walled cylinder closed at the extremities. To account for the effect of a closed cap pipe (pipe extremities condition) in the 12  final failure pressure, both the circumferential (hoop) and axial stresses are considered for the determination of the failure pressure. Circumferential stress (𝜎𝜃) = ( 𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜 𝑟𝑜−𝑟𝑖 ) = ( 𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜 𝑒 )                      (27) Axial stress (𝜎𝑧) = 𝜎𝜃 2 = ( 𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜 2∗(𝑟𝑜−𝑟𝑖)) = ( 𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜 2∗𝑒 )                       (28) As per the definition of the von Mises failure criterion, considering the circumferential and axial stresses on the cylinder, the failure criterion is reduced to: (𝜎𝜃)2 − (𝜎𝜃𝜎𝑧) + (𝜎𝑧)2 = 𝜎𝑦 2                            (29) Substituting the circumferential and axial stresses of the metallic pipeline reinforced with a composite sleeve in the above equation: ( 𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜 𝑒 ) 2 − ( 𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜 𝑒 ) ∗ ( 𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜 2𝑒 ) + ( 𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜 2𝑒 ) 2 = 𝜎𝑦 2                    (30) 3𝑃𝑖 2∗𝑟𝑖 2 4𝑒2 − 3𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖∗𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜 2𝑒2 + 3𝑃𝑐2∗𝑟𝑜2 4𝑒2 = 𝜎𝑦 2                            (31) To calculate the failure pressure of the pipe with a composite sleeve, there is a need to consider the ultimate stress, but for a safer design the yield stress would be preferable. Several researchers [22-24] have already related failure pressure 𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥 with the ultimate stress (𝜎𝑢𝑙𝑡) from a tensile test but generalized in terms of the flow stress (𝜎𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤) and the values are different depending on the selection of the remaining strength criteria. 3𝑃𝑖 2∗𝑟𝑖 2 4𝑒2 − 3𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖∗𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜 2𝑒2 + 3𝑃𝑐2∗𝑟𝑜2 4𝑒2 = 𝜎𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 2                            (32) From equation (23), 𝑃𝑐 = 𝛽𝑃𝑖, therefore, equation (32) becomes: ( 3𝑃𝑖 2∗𝑟𝑖 2 4𝑒2 − 3𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖∗𝛽𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑜 2𝑒2 + 3(𝛽𝑃𝑖)2∗𝑟𝑜2 4𝑒2 ) = 𝜎𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 2                          (33) It is possible to obtain the theoretical failure pressure, 𝑃𝑓 𝑡ℎ as: (𝑃𝑓 𝑡ℎ) 2 ( 3𝑟𝑖 2 4𝑒2 − 3𝛽𝑟𝑖𝑟𝑜 2𝑒2 + 3𝛽2𝑟𝑜2 4𝑒2 ) = 𝜎𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 2                                                  (34) 𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑡ℎ = 𝜎𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 √𝑘1     Where 𝑘1 = ( 3𝑟𝑖 2 4𝑒2 − 3𝛽𝑟𝑖𝑟𝑜 2𝑒2 + 3𝛽2𝑟𝑜2 4𝑒2 )                       (35) 13  To account for a localized defect section in the pipe a damage factor (𝛼𝜃) is introduced, therefore, the failure pressure of the metal wall loss defect pipe corrected by the factor 𝛼𝜃 is: 𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑡ℎ = 𝜎𝑢𝑙𝑡 𝛼𝜃√𝑘1                                 (36) On the other hand, without accounting for the axial stress, the failure criterion (von Mises) equation (29) is reduced to: 𝜎𝜃 = 𝜎𝑦                                       (37) From equation (27), the above equation becomes: ( 𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜 𝑟𝑜−𝑟𝑖 ) = 𝜎𝑦                                     (38) As we know, 𝑃𝑐 =  𝛽𝑃𝑖, therefore: ( 𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝛽𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑜 𝑒 ) = 𝜎𝑦                                       (39) Thus, for the maximum theoretical failure pressure the yield stress becomes the ultimate stress of the pipe: 𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑡ℎ ( 𝑟𝑖−𝛽𝑟𝑜 𝑒 ) = 𝜎𝑢𝑙𝑡                                               (40) 𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑡ℎ = 𝜎𝑢𝑙𝑡 𝑘2  ,  Where 𝑘2 = ( 𝑟𝑖−𝛽𝑟𝑜 𝑒 )                                      (41) 𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑡ℎ = 𝜎𝑢𝑙𝑡 𝛼𝜃𝑘2                                   (42) A total of 19 hydrostatic tests results are considered from different laboratories, including 3 hydrostatic tests results from our laboratory in order to validate the proposed methodology with and without accounting for the axial stress using different criterion [4, 20, 24-25]. Table 2 summarizes the geometrical and material properties of damaged pipelines reinforced with composites, as well as the experimental failure pressure of the tested specimens [4, 20, 24- 25]. As per the present methodology, only geometric and material properties of damaged pipelines and composite repair systems are required to calculate the theoretical failure pressure. The theoretical failure pressure is calculated based on different criteria: ASME B31G, RSTRENG 0.85 and their modified version and DNV subjected with and without axial stress are listed in Table 3. The theoretical failure pressure obtained from the proposed 14  models is higher and closer towards the experimental failure pressure than the previous model without accounting for the axial stress [17].

(Ptheoretical/Pexperimental) per test with and without accounting for the axial stress using DNV criterion. Figures 5-7 show the ratio between the predicted theoretical failure pressure and the experimental failure pressure (Ptheoretical/Pexperimental) with and without accounting for the axial stress using the criteria ASME B31G, RSTRENG 0.85, DNV and their modified version. The predicted failure pressure with accounting for the specimen extremities (axial stress) is more accurate than without the axial stress in all criteria except in some cases. Based on the three criteria, the DNV criterion shows an accurate prediction as well as reasonable and conservative for all tested specimens, while the RSTRENG 0.85* criterion is more accurate and closer to experimental values but over-predicted in some tests. Most of the conservative values of failure pressure are obtained under the ASME B31G and RSTRENG 0.85 criterion rather than the other criteria (ASME B31G*, RSTRENG 0.85* and DNV), the same trend was also noticed by other researchers [17, 24]. 17   Fig. 8. Comparison between predicted and experimental failure pressure for different conditions using ASME B31G criterion.   Fig. 9. Comparison between predicted and experimental failure pressure for different conditions using RSTRENG 0.85 criterion.   18   Fig. 10. Comparison between predicted and experimental failure pressure for different conditions using DNV criterion.  Figures 8-10 show the comparison between the experimental failure pressure and the predicted theoretical failure pressure with and without accounting for the axial stress using different criteria. The failure pressure with accounting for the axial stress in the proposed model predicted a  higher failure pressure than without axial stress for all criteria and is closer towards the experimental failure pressure but in some cases, it over-predicted for the ASME B31G* and RSTRENG 0.85* but not for the DNV criterion. The DNV criterion predicted an accurate and conservative failure pressure in all experiment tests but a more accurate prediction was obtained when the proposed methodology accounted for the axial stress. The proposed analysis, which accounts for the test specimen extremities (axial stress) shows more accurate results and requires properties of the pipe and the composite sleeve. All three criteria ASME B31G, RSTRENG 0.85, DNV and their modified version (ASME B31G*, RSTRENG 0.85*) have different failure pressure values in the proposed method, as it depends on the remaining strength factor and flow stress condition. From mixed trends results, it is observed that the pipe test specimen geometry and material properties also play an important role. Therefore, proper selection of criteria is necessary, as per the area of application and requirement of accuracy and conservative level of failure pressure. 19  Still, there is a difference between the theoretical failure pressure using the proposed methodology and the experimental failure pressure and this difference can be minimized by accounting for the plastic deformation of the pipe, variation of the thickness of the composite sleeve (radial stress) etc. as suggested by researchers [23, 24, 30, 31]. In the previous experimental study [12], the plastic deformation occurs far from the defect region, hence this phenomenon needs to be accounted for in the analysis for a more accurate prediction (Fig.11). Plastic deformation occurs at 85 mm distance away from the end of the defect region in both sides of the tube (left and right). There is scope to refine this proposed analysis by introducing the plastic deformation phenomenon with the cost of a more complex analytical equation and material properties under plastic deformation.  Fig. 11. Tube deformation during hydrostatic test [12].  5. Conclusions The present paper proposed a simple methodology to estimate the failure pressure of corroded pipelines reinforced with a composite sleeve. In this methodology, the metallic pipe extremities (closed end cap) were accounted for in the analysis, which is similar to the hydrostatic test specimen condition in order to predict a more accurate failure pressure. With a simple expression, a realistic estimate for the failure pressure of a corroded thin-walled pipe reinforced with a composite sleeve can be obtained. The estimation of the failure pressure requires only the knowledge of the properties of the pipe and composite sleeve, along with pipe specimen geometry. This methodology can also be used to define the composite repair thickness in order to assure a reliable operation under a defined pressure. 20  A total of 19 hydrostatic test results were validated with the proposed methodology. The correlation between the model prediction and the experimental failure pressure is good in most of the cases, which encourages the use of the model as a preliminary tool in the design/analysis of a composite repair system for damaged pipelines. The failure pressure calculated based on the proposed model with accounting for the pipe extremities (axial stress) is more accurate than the one that does not. Both accuracy and conservative level depends on the selection of criteria, for example ASME B31G is more conservative while RSTRENG 0.85* is more accurate but in some experiments it over-predicted, while the DNV criterion perfectly fit in terms of accuracy and conservativeness. Therefore, a careful selection of the remaining strength criteria based on the safety level and other factors is necessary. This new proposed methodology estimated more accurate results, but can still be refined with accounting for the radial stress and the fact that the plastic deformation of the tube occurs far from the defect region in the failure analysis.
