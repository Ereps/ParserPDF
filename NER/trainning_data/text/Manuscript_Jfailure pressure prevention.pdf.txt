Budhe, sandipiit@gmail.comAbstract:The present paper is concerned with the failure analysis of the wall loss defect in pipelinesreinforced with a polymer based composite repair system. The main goal is to propose amethodology with accounting for the pipe extremities (axial stress) in an analysis to predict anaccurate failure pressure. The proposed methodology defines a simple expression for a realtest specimen condition (closed cap cylinder), which allows to estimate the failure pressureusing the elastic properties of the materials and test specimen geometry. Hydrostatic testsperformed in different laboratories are used to validate the proposed methodology. The resultsshow a good agreement between the model prediction and the experimental failure pressureresults in all cases. However, a careful selection of the remaining strength factor is needed, asit impacts on the accuracy and conservative level of the failure pressure. In addition to theaxial stress, there is a possibility to refine the theoretical prediction of the failure pressurevalue by accounting for the plastic deformation far from the defect region as well as the radialstress in the failure analysis.Keywords: Failure pressure; axial stress; corroded metallic pipelines; hydrostatic test;composite repair systems2Nomenclature:𝑃𝑖  Internal pressure (MPa)  𝐸𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑣𝑒 Young’s modulus of the composite sleeve(MPa)𝑃𝑓  Failure pressure (MPa)  𝐸𝑟𝑟  Young’s modulus of the composite in theradial direction (MPa)𝑃𝑐  Contact pressure between the steelpipe and composite (MPa)𝐸𝜃𝜃  Young’s modulus of the composite in thecircumference direction (MPa)𝑟𝑖  Internal radius of steel pipe (mm)  𝜎𝜃  Circumferential stress in pipe (MPa)𝑟𝑜  External radius of steel pipe (mm)  𝜀𝜃𝑝  Plastic strain𝑟𝑒  External radius of compositerepair (mm)𝜀𝜃𝑒  Elastic strainepipe  Pipe thickness (mm)  𝜎𝑦  Yield stress of the pipe (MPa)esleeve  Composite repair thickness (mm)  𝜎𝑢𝑙𝑡  Ultimate stress of the pipe (MPa)𝛼𝜃  Remaining strength factor  𝜎𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤  Flow stress of the pipe (MPa)L  Defect length (mm)  K, N  Material constant for plastic characterizationw  Width of defect section (mm)  𝜈𝑟𝜃  Poisson’s ratioD  External diameter of the pipe(mm)𝜎𝑟  Radial stress in the pipe (MPa)d  Depth of defect (mm)  𝜎𝑧  Axial stress in the pipe (MPa)𝐸𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒  Young’s modulus of the pipe(MPa)𝜏𝑟𝜃  Shear stress in the 𝑟-𝜃 plane (MPa)𝑢𝑟  Radial displacement (mm)  𝜏𝜃𝑧  Shear stress in the 𝜃-z plane (MPa)𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑡ℎ   Maximum theoretical failurepressure (MPa)𝜏𝑟𝑧  Shear stress in the 𝑟-𝑧 plane (MPa)𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑒𝑥𝑝  Maximum experimental failurepressure (MPa)𝑀𝑡  Bulging factorσ1 σ2 σ3 Principal stresses along the 1, 2and 3 directionse  Cylinder thickness31. IntroductionIn recent years, it has been observed a rapid growth of the use of polymeric compositematerials to repair metallic and non-metallic structures in the aerospace, sports, construction,petroleum and oil industry [1-2]. The fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) matrix composite repairsystem is widely used for metallic pipelines in offshore and onshore units as it offers manyadvantages such as: corrosion prevention, quick repair, cold work, safety and it is moreeconomical etc. over a conventional welding repair method [3-7]. An assessment of acomposite repair system for corroded pipelines is in progress and many researchers carriedout hydrostatic testing of metallic pipelines reinforced with composites to assure the structuralintegrity [8-13]. Generally, hydrostatic tests are performed according to the ASME PCC-2[14] and ISO/TS 24817 [15] composite repair standards. Still, there is a continuousmodification of the standard over a theoretical failure pressure prediction with the input fromthe research studies [16-21].Several theoretical models have been proposed on corroded pipelines reinforced with apolymer based composite repair system under certain assumptions and were also validatedwith the hydrostatic test results [22-26]. Many proposed models predicted a reasonablyaccurate failure pressure but still there is a difference between the theoretical and theexperimental failure pressures. This difference is caused by many assumptions while derivingthe expression, such as, neglecting axial and radial stresses and not accounting for the plasticdeformation far away from the defect region. These assumptions help to derive a simpleexpression to predict the failure pressure using only the elastic properties of the materials butat the cost of low accuracy. Besides the composite material properties, the fiber orientation,stacking sequence, fiber placement, repair thickness, lay-up angle, material behavior modelare the important parameters for a pipe, where the stresses are generated along circumferentialand axial directions [27-29]. A sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the effect ofthese parameters and optimize the composite system for better performance and reliability ofthe composite structure also studied [27, 28]. Many authors [22-24, 30] suggested to accountfor these assumptions for a more accurate prediction of the failure pressure but still have notaccounted for it in the analysis, because of the complexity in the analytical expressions. Inaddition to these assumptions, the remaining strength and flow stress parameters are thepossible causes for the difference in the theoretical and experimental failure pressures, whichvaries as per selection criterion. There are many available criteria listed in the literature andthe most commonly used criteria are ASME B31G, RSTENG 0.85, DNV and their modified4version along with Ritchie and last, RC/Battelle, Chell, Sims, Kanninem and Chell [17, 31-36].The Failure analysis of corroded metallic pipelines reinforced with a polymer basedcomposite repair system is well developed but considered only the circumferential stress andneglected the axial and radial stresses [17]. The axial stress is neglected due to the fact thatthe real pipeline is open at both ends and is very long, however hydrostatic tests are usuallyperformed taking as cylindrical specimen closed at both ends. In the present work the problemis modelled in the context of elasto-plasticity as a thin-walled cylinder closed at theextremities (axial stress) to predict an accurate failure pressure. The material behavior isassumed to be elastic far from the defect region. In order to validate the effectiveness of theproposed methodology, the failure pressures obtained in a series of hydrostatic tests of pipesare compared with the theoretical failure pressure [4, 20, 24, 25]. Furthermore, the failurepressure is calculated by using different criteria and compared with the experimental results,in order to find the best criterion to be used based on the requirement of accuracy andconservative level.2. Thin-walled elastic-plastic pipe under internal pressureThe aim of this study is to propose a theoretical analysis constrained to thin-walled metallicpipes and considering a set of elastic-plastic constitutive equations to predict failure pressure.The idea is to obtain an analytical expression which can account for a more practicalcondition such as the pipe specimen extremities, variation of the thickness and localizedplastic deformation in order to predict a more accurate failure pressure.It is considered an elasto-plastic cylinder with internal radius ( 𝑟𝑖), pipe thickness (𝑒),subjected to an internal pressure ( 𝑃𝑖) (Fig. 1).𝒓𝒊 𝒆 > 10   Thin-wall cylinder condition                         (1)5Fig. 1. Pipe with internal pressure.The stress component of the thin-walled cylinder in the cylindrical co-ordinate system (r-θ-z)is as shown below:𝜎 = [𝜎𝑟 0 00 𝜎𝜃 00 0 𝜎𝑧]                                  (2)Where, 𝜎𝑟, 𝜎𝜃 and 𝜎𝑧 are the radial, circumferential and axial stress components of thecylinder, while the shear stresses 𝜏𝑟𝜃, 𝜏𝜃𝑧 and 𝜏𝑟𝑧 are neglected as they are relativelynegligible compared to the normal stress components.Considering a thin-walled isotropic cylinder and that the radial stress along the radialdirection is constant (𝜎𝑟 = 0), equation (2) becomes:𝜎 = [𝜎𝑟 = 0 0 00 𝜎𝜃 00 0 𝜎𝑧 = 𝜎𝜃/2]  for a closed cap cylinder (𝜎𝑧 ≠ 0)                    (3)𝜎 = [𝜎𝑟 = 0 0 00 𝜎𝜃 00 0 𝜎𝑧 = 0]   for an open cap cylinder (𝜎𝑧 = 0)                     (4)With, 𝜎𝜃 =𝑃𝑟𝑖 𝑒   and 𝜎𝑧 =𝜎𝜃 2 =𝑃𝑟𝑖 2𝑒                               (5)Generally, the axial stress is assumed to be negligible for long pipes but it becomes influentialwhen closed on both sides during a hydrostatic test. The axial stress in a closed pipe is almosthalf of the circumferential stress, so both stress components are dependent (𝜎𝑧 =𝜎𝜃 2 ) to eachother.6Considering the plastic deformation behavior of the pipe, the tangential stress becomes:𝜎𝜃 = 𝜎𝑦 + 𝐾(𝜀𝜃𝑝)𝑁if    𝜎𝜃 > 𝜎𝑦                              (6)Where, 𝜎𝑦 is the yielding stress, K and N are the positive material constants that characterizethe plastic behavior of the material. If, 𝜎𝜃 < 𝜎𝑦 it means no plastic deformation occurs, 𝜀𝜃𝑝=0.The total strain of the pipe material is as follows:𝜀𝜃 = 𝜀𝜃𝑒 + 𝜀𝜃𝑝 =𝜎𝜃 𝐸 + 𝜀𝜃𝑝                                (7)Assuming that, 𝜀𝜃 ≈𝑢𝑟 𝑟𝑖The radial displacement can be obtained through equation (8):𝑢𝑟 𝑟𝑖 =𝜎𝜃 𝐸 + (𝜎𝜃−𝜎𝑦𝐾 )1/𝑁(8)The radial displacement 𝑢𝑟 for the elastic-plastic behavior can be expressed as:𝑢𝑟 = 𝑟𝑖 [𝜎𝜃 𝐸 + (𝜎𝜃−𝜎𝑦𝐾 )1/𝑁]                                (9)While, the radial displacement for the elastic behavior can be expressed as:𝑢𝑟 = 𝑟𝑖 (𝜎𝜃 𝐸 )                                 (10)There are two classical yield failure criteria: the Tresca criterion and the von Mises criterionwhich are used extensively in structural stresses and deformation analysis. In this study, thevon Mises failure criterion is used to predict the theoretical failure pressure with accountingfor the circumferential and axial stresses. The Principal stresses σ1 (σz), σ2 (σθ) and σ3 (σr) areacting on the thin walled cylinder subjected to internal pressure as shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 2. Principal stresses on thin pressurized cylinder with closed end caps.7As per the definition of the von Mises yield failure criterion, the general form of the vonMises failure criterion in terms of principal stresses is:1√2 [(𝜎1 − 𝜎2)2 + (𝜎2 − 𝜎3)2 + (𝜎3 − 𝜎1)2]1/2 = 𝜎𝑦                      (11)The plane stress (thin cylinder), 𝜎3 (𝜎𝑟) = 0, therefore, the von Mises criterion for cylindricalcoordinates (r-θ-z), assuming that the radial stress is zero, 𝜎𝑟 = 0, yields equation (12):[(𝜎𝜃)2 − (𝜎𝜃𝜎𝑧) + (𝜎𝑧)2]1/2 = 𝜎𝑦                           (12)The above equation is valid, if the pipe is closed, which confirms the presence of an axialstress term in the analysis, otherwise for the open ended cylinder condition (𝜎𝑧 = 0), equation(12) reduces to:𝜎𝜃 = 𝜎𝑦                                  (13)This form is the most used as it is simple and easy to formulate the mathematical expressionfor the failure pressure of a damaged pipe and it gives a more conservative failure value as itconsiders only the circumferential stress.The internal failure pressure for the cylinder with elastic behavior is:𝜎𝜃 = 𝜎𝑦 =𝑃𝑟𝑖 𝑒                                       (14)𝑃 =(𝑒𝜎𝑦)𝑟𝑖                                                  (15)The maximum theoretical failure pressure can be related to the ultimate stress, 𝜎𝑢𝑙𝑡, as it wasexplained in [22, 23].𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑡ℎ =(𝑒∗𝜎𝑢𝑙𝑡)𝑟𝑖                                 (16)3. Remaining strength criteria for wall loss defects (𝛼𝜃)The wall loss defect in metallic pipes is taken into account by the remaining strengthfactor (damage factor). This factor (𝛼𝜃) is a function of defect and pipe geometry and variesaccording to the selection criteria. All these criteria can be expressed as follows:𝜎𝜃 = 𝛼𝜃 (𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖𝑒 )𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑑                                 (17)8The maximum theoretical failure pressure of the wall loss defect of a metallic pipeline can bedetermined as:𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑡ℎ =𝑒𝛼𝜃𝑟𝑖 𝜎𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤                                   (18)Where, 𝛼𝜃 is the damage factor and 𝜎𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 is the maximum allowable strength beforefailure, both parameters vary according to the criterion. ASME B31G and RSTRENG 0.85criteria are the most widely used for corroded pipelines subjected to an internal pressure [17,32-35]. The difference between the many criteria is the option of the flow stress and theexpression for the remaining strength factor, so careful selection of criterion is needed. Theremaining strength factor and flow stress formulae of ASME B31G, RSTRENG and DNVand the modified version of each criterion are listed in Table. 1. The most widely used criteriaare ASME B31G, RSTRENG 0.85 and DNV and their modified version, as these criteriapredict a more accurate failure pressure than other criteria [17, 24, 25].Table 1 Criterion for remaining strength factor and flow stress equationCriteriaRemaining strength factor(𝛼𝜃)Bulging FactorFlow stressASME B31G [34,36]𝐼𝑓 𝐴𝑓 ≤ 4,    𝛼𝜃 =1−23( 𝑑𝑒√𝐴𝑓2+1)1−23(𝑑𝑒)𝐼𝑓𝐴𝑓 > 4 ,    𝛼𝜃 =𝑒𝑒−𝑑𝐴𝑓 = 0.893 (𝐿√𝐷𝑒)𝜎𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 = 1.1𝜎𝑦ASME B31G* [17,36]Same as ASME B1G  Same as ASME B1G  𝜎𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 = 𝜎𝑢𝑙𝑡RSTRENG 0.85 [34,36]𝛼𝜃 =1 − 0.85 (𝑑𝑒) ( 1𝑀𝑡)1 − 0.85 (𝑑𝑒)𝑀𝑡 =√1 + 0.275 (𝐿2𝐷𝑒) − 0.00375 (𝐿2𝐷𝑒)2𝑀𝑡 = 3.3 + 0.032 (𝐿2𝐷𝑒)𝜎𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 = 𝜎𝑦 +69RSTRENG  0.85*[17, 36]Same as RSTRENG 0.85  Same as RSTRENG 0.85  𝜎𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 = 𝜎𝑢𝑙𝑡DNV [17]𝛼𝜃 = [1−(𝑑𝑒)(1𝑄)1−(𝑑𝑒) ]𝑄𝑡 = √1 + 0.31 (𝐿2𝐷𝑒)𝜎𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 = 𝜎𝑢𝑙𝑡94. Proposed methodology for failure pressure analysis of composite repair systemThe present section is concerned with the analysis of composite sleeve reinforcement systemsfor metallic pipelines, which accounts for a practical condition such as pipe specimenextremities (closed cap cylinder) for predicting a more accurate failure pressure.The basic assumption is that the wall loss defect is localized and thus the stress and strainfields far from the defect are not subjected to plastic deformation. As a consequence, thematerial behavior is assumed to be elastic far from the defect. The behavior of steel pipe atdefect section is idealized an elastic-perfectly plastic (without strain hardening of steel). Thepipe-composite sleeve system is modelled as two concentric thin-walled cylinders subjectedto an internal pressure Pi and contact pressure Pc between the pipe and composite sleeve (Fig.3). The pipe has an inner radius ri   and external diameter D with defect length L and depth d,while the composite sleeve has an internal radius ro and external radius re (Fig. 4).Fig. 3. Pipe and sleeve with internal and contact pressure.If the wall thickness of a pipe epipe is less than 1/10th of the internal radius of the cylinder,epipe=(ro-ri)<(ri/10), then the cylinder wall is considered thin, otherwise, it is considered thick[31]. Similarly for the composite sleeve, esleeve=(re-ro)<(ro/10).10Fig. 4.

Assuming that the radialdisplacement in the contact surface is the same for both cylinders, it is possible to obtainanalytical expressions for the stress, strain and displacement fields. The contact surfacebetween the pipe and the composite sleeve can be approximated using the following relationand correlate with the initial pressure.[Radial displacement] pipe = [Radial displacement] sleeve[𝑢𝑟]𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒 = [𝑢𝑟]𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑣𝑒                               (19)𝑟𝑖[𝜀𝜃]𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒 = 𝑟𝑜[𝜀𝜃]𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑣𝑒                              (20)𝑟𝑖[𝜎𝜃]𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒𝐸𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒 = 𝑟𝑜[𝜎𝜃]𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑣𝑒𝐸𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑣𝑒                               (21)𝑟𝑖𝐸𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒 (𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑟𝑜−𝑟𝑖 ) =𝑟𝑜𝐸𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑣𝑒 (𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜 𝑟𝑒−𝑟𝑜)                            (22)The contact pressure, 𝑃𝑐, acting between the pipe and the composite sleeve (Fig. 4) can beapproximated in terms of internal pressure using the following relation:𝑃𝑐 = 𝑃𝑖 [(𝑟0−𝑟𝑖)(𝑟𝑒−𝑟𝑜) (𝐸𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒 𝐸𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑣𝑒) (𝑟0 𝑟𝑖)2+ (𝑟0 𝑟𝑖)]−1= 𝛽𝑃𝑖                        (23)If the composite repair thickness (esleeve) is higher than 1/10th of the external radius of the steeltube ro then, the sleeve’s radial displacement cannot be assumed constant. In this case, theequations 19, 22, and 23 becomes:[𝑢𝑟]𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒 = [𝑢𝑟 (𝑟 = 𝑟𝑜)]𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑣𝑒                            (24)𝑟𝑖𝐸𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒 (𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑟0−𝑟𝑖 ) = −𝐵𝑃𝑐𝐾𝑟𝑜−𝑘 (1𝐸𝜃𝜃 +𝜈𝑟𝜃 𝐸𝑟𝑟) + 𝐶𝑃𝑐𝐾𝑟𝑜𝑘 (1𝐸𝜃𝜃 −𝜈𝑟𝜃 𝐸𝑟𝑟)                   (25)𝑃𝑐 =𝑟𝑖2𝐸𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒(𝑟𝑖−𝑟𝑜)−𝐵𝐾𝑟𝑜−𝑘( 1𝐸𝜃𝜃+𝜈𝑟𝜃 𝐸𝑟𝑟)+𝐶𝐾𝑟𝑜𝑘( 1𝐸𝜃𝜃−𝜈𝑟𝜃 𝐸𝑟𝑟)+𝑟𝑖 𝑟𝑜𝐸𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒(𝑟𝑖−𝑟𝑜)𝑃𝑖 = 𝛽𝑃𝑖                     (26)Where, 𝐾 = √Eθ Er,𝐵 = (𝑟𝑒𝐾−1[𝑟𝑜−(𝐾+1)𝑟𝑒(𝐾−1)− 𝑟𝑜(𝐾+1)𝑟𝑒−(𝐾−1)]), 𝐶 = (𝑟𝑒−(𝐾−1)[𝑟𝑜−(𝐾+1)𝑟𝑒(𝐾−1)− 𝑟𝑜(𝐾+1)𝑟𝑒−(𝐾−1)])Let us consider the axial stress component (test pipe extremities) in the failure pressureanalysis that is not accounted in previous studies. Usually, the hydrostatic tests are performedconsidering a cylindrical specimen closed at the both ends using a welded cap or a boltedpressure flange. However, in reality, the pipeline is not closed, therefore, the effect of axialstresses in the longitudinal direction is almost negligible. In the present analysis the problemis modelled in the context of elasto-plasticity as a thin-walled cylinder closed at theextremities. To account for the effect of a closed cap pipe (pipe extremities condition) in the12final failure pressure, both the circumferential (hoop) and axial stresses are considered for thedetermination of the failure pressure.Circumferential stress (𝜎𝜃) = (𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑟𝑜−𝑟𝑖 ) = (𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑒 )                      (27)Axial stress (𝜎𝑧) =𝜎𝜃 2 = (𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜 2∗(𝑟𝑜−𝑟𝑖)) = (𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜2∗𝑒 )                       (28)As per the definition of the von Mises failure criterion, considering the circumferential andaxial stresses on the cylinder, the failure criterion is reduced to:(𝜎𝜃)2 − (𝜎𝜃𝜎𝑧) + (𝜎𝑧)2 = 𝜎𝑦2                            (29)Substituting the circumferential and axial stresses of the metallic pipeline reinforced with acomposite sleeve in the above equation:(𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑒 )2− (𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑒 ) ∗ (𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜2𝑒 ) + (𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜2𝑒 )2= 𝜎𝑦2                    (30)3𝑃𝑖2∗𝑟𝑖24𝑒2 −3𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖∗𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜2𝑒2 +3𝑃𝑐2∗𝑟𝑜24𝑒2 = 𝜎𝑦2                            (31)To calculate the failure pressure of the pipe with a composite sleeve, there is a need toconsider the ultimate stress, but for a safer design the yield stress would be preferable. Severalresearchers [22-24] have already related failure pressure 𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥 with the ultimate stress (𝜎𝑢𝑙𝑡)from a tensile test but generalized in terms of the flow stress (𝜎𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤) and the values aredifferent depending on the selection of the remaining strength criteria.3𝑃𝑖2∗𝑟𝑖24𝑒2 −3𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖∗𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜2𝑒2 +3𝑃𝑐2∗𝑟𝑜24𝑒2 = 𝜎𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤2                            (32)From equation (23), 𝑃𝑐 = 𝛽𝑃𝑖, therefore, equation (32) becomes:(3𝑃𝑖2∗𝑟𝑖24𝑒2 −3𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖∗𝛽𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑜2𝑒2 +3(𝛽𝑃𝑖)2∗𝑟𝑜24𝑒2 ) = 𝜎𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤2                          (33)It is possible to obtain the theoretical failure pressure, 𝑃𝑓𝑡ℎ as:(𝑃𝑓𝑡ℎ)2 (3𝑟𝑖24𝑒2 −3𝛽𝑟𝑖𝑟𝑜2𝑒2 +3𝛽2𝑟𝑜24𝑒2 ) = 𝜎𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤2                                                  (34)𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑡ℎ =𝜎𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 √𝑘1     Where 𝑘1 = (3𝑟𝑖24𝑒2 −3𝛽𝑟𝑖𝑟𝑜2𝑒2 +3𝛽2𝑟𝑜24𝑒2 )                       (35)13To account for a localized defect section in the pipe a damage factor (𝛼𝜃) is introduced,therefore, the failure pressure of the metal wall loss defect pipe corrected by the factor 𝛼𝜃 is:𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑡ℎ =𝜎𝑢𝑙𝑡𝛼𝜃√𝑘1                                 (36)On the other hand, without accounting for the axial stress, the failure criterion (von Mises)equation (29) is reduced to:𝜎𝜃 = 𝜎𝑦                                       (37)From equation (27), the above equation becomes:(𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝑃𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑟𝑜−𝑟𝑖 ) = 𝜎𝑦                                     (38)As we know, 𝑃𝑐 =  𝛽𝑃𝑖, therefore:(𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑖−𝛽𝑃𝑖𝑟𝑜𝑒 ) = 𝜎𝑦                                       (39)Thus, for the maximum theoretical failure pressure the yield stress becomes the ultimate stressof the pipe:𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑡ℎ (𝑟𝑖−𝛽𝑟𝑜𝑒 ) = 𝜎𝑢𝑙𝑡                                               (40)𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑡ℎ =𝜎𝑢𝑙𝑡 𝑘2  ,  Where 𝑘2 = (𝑟𝑖−𝛽𝑟𝑜𝑒 )                                      (41)𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑡ℎ =𝜎𝑢𝑙𝑡 𝛼𝜃𝑘2                                   (42)A total of 19 hydrostatic tests results are considered from different laboratories, including 3hydrostatic tests results from our laboratory in order to validate the proposed methodologywith and without accounting for the axial stress using different criterion [4, 20, 24-25]. Table2 summarizes the geometrical and material properties of damaged pipelines reinforced withcomposites, as well as the experimental failure pressure of the tested specimens [4, 20, 24-25]. As per the present methodology, only geometric and material properties of damagedpipelines and composite repair systems are required to calculate the theoretical failurepressure. The theoretical failure pressure is calculated based on different criteria: ASMEB31G, RSTRENG 0.85 and their modified version and DNV subjected with and without axialstress are listed in Table 3. The theoretical failure pressure obtained from the proposed14models is higher and closer towards the experimental failure pressure than the previous modelwithout accounting for the axial stress [17].Fig. 5.

(Ptheoretical/Pexperimental) per test with and without accounting for the axial stress usingDNV criterion.Figures 5-7 show the ratio between the predicted theoretical failure pressure and theexperimental failure pressure (Ptheoretical/Pexperimental) with and without accounting for the axialstress using the criteria ASME B31G, RSTRENG 0.85, DNV and their modified version.The predicted failure pressure with accounting for the specimen extremities (axial stress) ismore accurate than without the axial stress in all criteria except in some cases. Based on thethree criteria, the DNV criterion shows an accurate prediction as well as reasonable andconservative for all tested specimens, while the RSTRENG 0.85* criterion is more accurateand closer to experimental values but over-predicted in some tests. Most of the conservativevalues of failure pressure are obtained under the ASME B31G and RSTRENG 0.85 criterionrather than the other criteria (ASME B31G*, RSTRENG 0.85* and DNV), the same trendwas also noticed by other researchers [17, 24].17Fig. 8. Comparison between predicted and experimental failure pressure for differentconditions using ASME B31G criterion.Fig. 9. Comparison between predicted and experimental failure pressure for differentconditions using RSTRENG 0.85 criterion.18Fig. 10. Comparison between predicted and experimental failure pressure for differentconditions using DNV criterion.Figures 8-10 show the comparison between the experimental failure pressure and thepredicted theoretical failure pressure with and without accounting for the axial stress usingdifferent criteria. The failure pressure with accounting for the axial stress in the proposedmodel predicted a  higher failure pressure than without axial stress for all criteria and is closertowards the experimental failure pressure but in some cases, it over-predicted for the ASMEB31G* and RSTRENG 0.85* but not for the DNV criterion. The DNV criterion predicted anaccurate and conservative failure pressure in all experiment tests but a more accurateprediction was obtained when the proposed methodology accounted for the axial stress. Theproposed analysis, which accounts for the test specimen extremities (axial stress) shows moreaccurate results and requires properties of the pipe and the composite sleeve. All three criteriaASME B31G, RSTRENG 0.85, DNV and their modified version (ASME B31G*, RSTRENG0.85*) have different failure pressure values in the proposed method, as it depends on theremaining strength factor and flow stress condition. From mixed trends results, it is observedthat the pipe test specimen geometry and material properties also play an important role.Therefore, proper selection of criteria is necessary, as per the area of application andrequirement of accuracy and conservative level of failure pressure.19Still, there is a difference between the theoretical failure pressure using the proposedmethodology and the experimental failure pressure and this difference can be minimized byaccounting for the plastic deformation of the pipe, variation of the thickness of the compositesleeve (radial stress) etc. as suggested by researchers [23, 24, 30, 31]. In the previousexperimental study [12], the plastic deformation occurs far from the defect region, hence thisphenomenon needs to be accounted for in the analysis for a more accurate prediction (Fig.11).Plastic deformation occurs at 85 mm distance away from the end of the defect region in bothsides of the tube (left and right). There is scope to refine this proposed analysis by introducingthe plastic deformation phenomenon with the cost of a more complex analytical equation andmaterial properties under plastic deformation.Fig. 11. Tube deformation during hydrostatic test [12].5. ConclusionsThe present paper proposed a simple methodology to estimate the failure pressure of corrodedpipelines reinforced with a composite sleeve. In this methodology, the metallic pipeextremities (closed end cap) were accounted for in the analysis, which is similar to thehydrostatic test specimen condition in order to predict a more accurate failure pressure. With asimple expression, a realistic estimate for the failure pressure of a corroded thin-walled pipereinforced with a composite sleeve can be obtained. The estimation of the failure pressurerequires only the knowledge of the properties of the pipe and composite sleeve, along withpipe specimen geometry. This methodology can also be used to define the composite repairthickness in order to assure a reliable operation under a defined pressure.20A total of 19 hydrostatic test results were validated with the proposed methodology. Thecorrelation between the model prediction and the experimental failure pressure is good inmost of the cases, which encourages the use of the model as a preliminary tool in thedesign/analysis of a composite repair system for damaged pipelines. The failure pressurecalculated based on the proposed model with accounting for the pipe extremities (axial stress)is more accurate than the one that does not. Both accuracy and conservative level depends onthe selection of criteria, for example ASME B31G is more conservative while RSTRENG0.85* is more accurate but in some experiments it over-predicted, while the DNV criterionperfectly fit in terms of accuracy and conservativeness. Therefore, a careful selection of theremaining strength criteria based on the safety level and other factors is necessary. This newproposed methodology estimated more accurate results, but can still be refined withaccounting for the radial stress and the fact that the plastic deformation of the tube occurs farfrom the defect region in the failure analysis.AcknowledgementsAuthors would like to acknowledge the support of the Brazilian Research Agencies CNPq,CAPES and FAPERJ.Conflict of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.References:1.
