One explanation for the deﬁcit is the transformation of the Sun’s electron-type neutrinos into other active ﬂavors. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) measures the 8B solar neutrinos through the reactions ne 1 d ! p 1 p 1 e2 CC , nx 1 d ! p 1 n 1 nx NC, nx 1 e2 ! nx 1 e2 ES . The charged current (CC) reaction is sensitive exclusively to electron-type neutrinos, while the neutral current (NC) is sensitive to all active neutrino ﬂavors (x  e, m, t). The elastic scattering (ES) reaction is sensitive to all ﬂavors as well, but with reduced sensitivity to nm and nt. By itself, the ES reaction cannot provide a measure of the total 8B ﬂux or its ﬂavor content. Comparison of the 8B ﬂux deduced from the ES reaction, assuming no neutrino oscillations [fESnx], to that measured by the CC reaction [fCCne] can provide clear evidence of ﬂavor transformation without reference to solar model ﬂux calculations. If neutrinos from the Sun change into other active ﬂavors, then fCCne , fESnx. This Letter presents the ﬁrst results from SNO on the ES and CC reactions. SNO’s measurement of fESnx is consistent with previous measurements described in Ref. [5]. The measurement of fCCne, however, is signiﬁcantly smaller and is therefore inconsistent with the null hypothesis that all observed solar neutrinos are ne. A measurement using the NC reaction, which has equal sensitivity to all neutrino ﬂavors, will be reported in a future publication. SNO [9] is an imaging water ˇCerenkov detector located at a depth of 6010 m of water equivalent in the INCO, Ltd. Creighton mine near Sudbury, Ontario. It features 1000 metric tons of ultrapure D2O contained in a 12-m diameter spherical acrylic vessel. This sphere is surrounded by a shield of ultrapure H2O contained in a 34-m-high barrel-shaped cavity of maximum diameter 22 m. A stainless steel structure 17.8 m in diameter supports 9456 20-cm photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) with light concentrators. Approximately 55% of the light produced within 7 m of the center of the detector will strike a PMT if it is not absorbed by intervening media. The data reported here were recorded between November 2, 1999 and January 15, 2001 and correspond to a live time of 240.95 days. Events are deﬁned by a multiplicity trigger of 18 or more PMTs exceeding a threshold of 0.25 photoelectrons within a time window of 93 ns. The trigger reaches 100% efﬁciency at 23 PMTs. The total instantaneous trigger rate is 15–18 Hz, of which 6–8 Hz is the data trigger. For every event trigger, the time and charge responses of each participating PMT are recorded. The data were partitioned into two sets, with approximately 70% used to establish the data analysis procedures and 30% reserved for a blind test of statistical bias in the analysis. The analysis procedures were frozen before the blind data set was analyzed, and no statistically signiﬁcant differences in the data sets were found. We present here the analysis of the combined data sets. Calibration of the PMT time and charge pedestals, slopes, offsets, charge vs time dependencies, and second order rate dependencies are performed using electronic pulsers and pulsed light sources. Optical calibration is obtained by using a diffuse source of pulsed laser light at 337, 365, 386, 420, 500, and 620 nm. The absolute energy scale and uncertainties are established with a triggered 16N source (predominantly 6.13-MeV g’s) deployed over two planar grids within the D2O and a linear grid in the H2O. The resulting Monte Carlo predictions of detector response are tested using a 252Cf neutron source, which provides an extended distribution of 6.25-MeV g rays from neutron capture, and a 3Hp,g4He [10] source providing 19.8-MeV g rays. The volume-weighted mean response is approximately nine PMT hits per MeV of electron energy. Table I details the steps in data reduction. The ﬁrst of these is the elimination of instrumental backgrounds. Electrical pickup may produce false PMT hits, while electrical discharges in the PMTs or insulating detector materials produce light. These backgrounds have characteristics very different from ˇCerenkov light, and are eliminated by using cuts based only on the PMT positions, the PMT time and charge data, event-to-event time correlations, and veto PMTs. This step in the data reduction is veriﬁed by comparing results from two independent background rejection analyses. For events passing the ﬁrst stage, the calibrated times and positions of the hit PMTs are used to reconstruct the vertex position and the direction of the particle. The reconstruction accuracy and resolution are measured using Compton electrons from the 16N source, and the energy and source variation of reconstruction are checked with a 8Li b source. Angular resolution is measured using Compton electrons produced more than 150 cm from the 16N source. At these energies, the vertex resolution is 16 cm and the angular resolution is 26.7±. An effective kinetic energy, Teff, is assigned to each event passing the reconstruction stage. Teff is calculated TABLE I. Data reduction steps.

The uncertainty on the energy scale is found to be 61.4%, which results in a ﬂux uncertainty nearly 4 times larger. For validation, a second energy estimator counts all PMTs hit in each event, Nhit, without position and direction corrections. Further instrumental background rejection is obtained by using reconstruction ﬁgures of merit, PMT time residuals, and the average angle between hit PMTs (uij), measured from the reconstructed vertex. These cuts test the hypothesis that each event has the characteristics of single electron ˇCerenkov light. The effects of these and the rest of the instrumental background removal cuts on neutrino signals are quantiﬁed using the 8Li and 16N sources deployed throughout the detector. The volume-weighted neutrino signal loss is measured to be 1.410.7 20.6% and the residual instrumental contamination for the data set within the D2O is ,0.2%. Lastly, cosmic ray induced neutrons and spallation products are removed using a 20 s coincidence window with the parent muon. Figure 1 shows the radial distribution of all remaining events above a threshold of Teff $ 6.75 MeV. The distribution is expressed as a function of the volume-weighted radial variable RRAV3, where RAV  6.00 m is the radius of the acrylic vessel. Above this energy threshold, there are contributions from CC events in the D2O, ES events in the D2O and H2O, a residual tail of neutron capture events, and high energy g rays from radioactivity in the outer detector. The data show a clear signal within the D2O volume. For RRAV3 . 1.0 the distribution rises into the H2O region until it is cut off by the acceptance of the PMT light collectors at R  7.0 m. A ﬁducial volume cut is applied at R  5.50 m to reduce backgrounds from regions exterior to the D2O, and to minimize systematic uncertainties associated with optics and reconstruction near the acrylic vessel. Possible backgrounds from radioactivity in the D2O and H2O are measured by regular low level radio assays of U and Th decay chain products in these regions. The ˇCerenkov light character of D2O and H2O radioactivity backgrounds is used in situ to monitor backgrounds between radio assays. Low energy radioactivity backgrounds are removed by the high threshold imposed, as are most neutron capture events. Monte Carlo calculations predict that the H2O shield effectively reduces contributions of low energy (,4 MeV) g rays from the PMT array, and these predictions are veriﬁed by deploying an encapsulated Th source in the vicinity of the PMT support sphere. High energy g rays from the cavity are also attenuated by the Acrylic vessel PMT array (R/RAV)3 Events/(0.07 Cubic AV Radii) 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 FIG. 1.

The total contribution from all radioactivity in the detector is found to be ,0.2% for low energy backgrounds and ,0.8% for high energy backgrounds. The ﬁnal data set contains 1169 events after the ﬁducial volume and kinetic energy threshold cuts. Figure 2(a) displays the distribution of cosuØ, the angle between the reconstructed direction of the event and the instantaneous direction from the Sun to the Earth. The forward peak in this distribution arises from the kinematics of the ES reaction, while CC electrons are expected to have a distribution which is 1 2 0.340 cosuØ [11], before accounting for detector response. The data are resolved into contributions from CC, ES, and neutron events above threshold using probability density functions (pdf’s) in Teff, cosuØ, and RRAV3, generated from Monte Carlo simulations assuming no ﬂavor transformation and the shape of the standard 8B spectrum [12] (hep neutrinos are not included in the ﬁt). The extended maximum likelihood method used in the signal extraction yields 975.4 6 39.7 CC events, 106.1 6 15.2 ES events, and 87.5 6 24.7 neutron events for the ﬁducial volume and the threshold chosen, where the uncertainties given are statistical only. The dominant sources of systematic uncertainty in this signal extraction are the energy scale uncertainty and reconstruction accuracy, as shown in Table II. The CC and ES signal decomposition gives consistent results when used with the Nhit energy estimator, as well as with different choices of the analysis threshold 071301-3 071301-3 VOLUME 87, NUMBER 7 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 13 AUGUST 2001 cos θO Events/(0.1 wide bin) .......

Radiative corrections have not been applied to the CC cross section, but they are expected to decrease the measured fCCne ﬂux [14] by up to a few percent. The difference between the 8B ﬂux deduced from the ES rate and that deduced from the CC rate in SNO is 0.64 6 0.40 3 106 cm22 s21, or 1.6s. The SNO’s ES rate measurement is consistent with the precision measurement by Super-Kamiokande Collaboration of the 8B ﬂux using the same ES reaction [5]: fES SKnx  2.32 6 0.03stat10.08 20.07syst 3 106 cm22 s21. The difference between the ﬂux fESnx measured by Super-Kamiokande via the ES reaction and the fCCne ﬂux measured by SNO via the CC reaction is 0.57 6 0.17 3 106 cm22 s21, or 3.3s [15], assuming that the systematic errors are normally distributed. The probability that a downward ﬂuctuation of the Super-Kamiokande result would produce a SNO result $3.3s is 0.04%. For reference, the ratio of the SNO CC 8B ﬂux to that of the BPB01 solar model [7] is 0.347 6 0.029, where all uncertainties are added in quadrature. If oscillation solely to a sterile neutrino is occurring, the SNO CC-derived 8B ﬂux above a threshold of 6.75 MeV will be consistent with the integrated Super-Kamiokande ES-derived 8B ﬂux above a threshold of 8.5 MeV [16]. By adjusting the ES threshold [5], this derived ﬂux difference is 0.53 6 0.17 3 106 cm22 s21, or 3.1s. The probability of a downward ﬂuctuation $3.1s is 0.13%. These data are therefore evidence of a nonelectron active ﬂavor component in the solar neutrino ﬂux. These data are also inconsistent with the “Just-So2” parameters for neutrino oscillation [17]. 071301-4 071301-4 VOLUME 87, NUMBER 7 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 13 AUGUST 2001 φ(νe) (106 cm-2s-1) φ(νµτ) (106 cm-2s-1) φ(νe) (relative to BPB01) φ(νµτ) (relative to BPB01) φES = φ(νe) + 0.154 φ(νµτ) φSK φCC φES φSNO φSK φx φx φSK+SNO φSSM 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 2 4 6 8 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 FIG. 3.

The two data bands represent the one standard deviation measurements of the SNO CC rate and the Super-Kamiokande ES rate.

The total ﬂux of active 8B neutrinos is determined to be fnx  5.44 6 0.99 3 106 cm22 s21. This result is displayed as a diagonal band in Fig. 3, and is in excellent agreement with predictions of standard solar models [7,8]. Assuming that the oscillation of massive neutrinos explains both the evidence for the electron neutrino ﬂavor change presented here and the atmospheric neutrino data of the Super-Kamiokande collaboration [18], two separate splittings of the squares of the neutrino mass eigenvalues are indicated: ,1023 eV2 for the solar sector [19,17] and  3.5 3 1023 eV2 for atmospheric neutrinos. These results, together with the beta spectrum of tritium [20], limit the sum of mass eigenvalues of active neutrinos to be between 0.05 and 8.4 eV, corresponding to a constraint of 0.001 , Vn , 0.18 for the contribution to the critical density of the Universe [21,22]. In summary, the results presented here are the ﬁrst direct indication of a nonelectron ﬂavor component in the solar neutrino ﬂux, and enable the ﬁrst determination of the total ﬂux of 8B neutrinos generated by the Sun.
