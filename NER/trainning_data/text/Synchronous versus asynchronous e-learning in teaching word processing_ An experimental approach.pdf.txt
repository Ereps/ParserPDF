E-learning has been introduced to ensure wide  dissemination of such fundamental content and skills, even beyond school. However, best methodologies need to be identified  for efficient instructional delivery. This study therefore investigated the effects of synchronous and asynchronous e-learning  on students’ cognitive academic achievement and practical skills acquisition in word processing. The study adopted a quasiexperimental research design using a pre-test, post-test, and non-equivalent and non-randomized grouping of two groups of  students. The study revealed that both synchronous and asynchronous e-learning significantly increased students’ achievement  and skills acquisition in word processing irrespective of the gender of the students. However, students taught through the  asynchronous mode displayed higher cognitive achievement while those taught through the synchronous e-learning mode  displayed improved skills acquisition.    Keywords: achievement; asynchronous; e-learning; skills acquisition; synchronous; word processing    Introduction  Word processing is a practical computer application used to create letters, reports, newsletters, tables, brochures,  and web pages. It can help users to add pictures, tables and charts to documents and enables the checking of  spelling and grammar in such documents. According to Kennedy (2009), word processing refers to the creation  of documents using a word processor, which permit users to draft letters, write books, and create other wordcentric documents on a computer. Word-processing programmes are typically designed with the author in mind,  offering tools and user interfaces that make writing easier, such as edit functions (e.g. cut, copy, paste, find,  replace, et cetera.), checking spelling and grammar, formatting documents and the like (Kotler, Gounares, Fisher,  Wolf, Anantharaman, Morgan & Franklin, 2008). Word processing skills are crucial as they constitute the basic  skills that will usher students into effective use of other software applications. Word-processing skills refer to what is required to use an application to create professional documents. These skills are necessary to create letters, electronic mails (emails), reports and other documents and can help an  individual to create and organise attractive and readable documents. Word processing, therefore, supports both  secretarial and administrative functions. Word-processing skills are usually the first skills taught in computer studies at school. Skills acquisition refers to the ability to be trained on a particular task or function to a level of expertise. It is a gradual developmental  process that requires cognitive (thinking) processes in conjunction with physical abilities to learn how to perform  movements that were previously unfamiliar. Word processing provides the basic skills for someone to become  computer literate. Obi (2005) states that the objectives of teaching word processing are to enable students to  develop proofreading skills, learn the rudiments of operating word processors and the computer, develop the  ability to select appropriate word-processing packages for use, develop an appreciation of word processing,  develop a positive work attitude in office information systems, teach learners the uses of the different available  word-processing packages, build a background to enable learners to acquire skills for Internet training, and train  learners to use templates efficiently. These templates include in-built design formats of professional documents  such as letters, memos and reports that users can open and modify to suit their needs. To achieve the above  objectives the right teaching methods need to be applied in the teaching and learning process. The teaching of word processing involves more than just using textbooks or a teacher’s manual. Computer studies teachers need to provide maximum exposure to the students, but this cannot be achieved through the  traditional methods mostly used in secondary schools in Nigeria. The traditional face-to-face approach to teaching  is regarded as one-way communication, since the teacher takes up the role of the subject matter master. The quality  of instruction depends on the teacher’s knowledge and the time allocated to a period in the school setting. The  learners are passive receivers of information and depend on the teacher through the entire learning process. This  scenario results in learners, even after having completed a practical topic like word processing in class, not having  a firm grip of the subject matter and the associated activities. These weaknesses associated with the traditional  teaching approach led to a paradigm shift towards learner-centred teaching. Thus, effective teaching usually  occurs using the learner-centred approach especially when technology is integrated (Akinleye, 2001). In addition,  the fundamental function of any technology used in education should be to deliver supplementary approaches that  can be used to address challenges faced by educators and students (Jaffer, N’gambi & Czerniewicz, 2007). 2  Ogbonna, Ibezim, Obi Consequently, interactive automated learner-centred  methods like e-learning have been introduced and  adopted. E-learning is the use of electronic media,  and technologies in education (Nichols, 2007). It  refers to the use of modern technology, such as  computers, digital technology, networked digital  devices (such as the Internet) and associated  software and courseware to facilitate the learning  process (Clover, 2017; Food and Agriculture  Organization of the United Nations [FAO], 2011).  Two basic methodologies are used in e-learning,  namely asynchronous and synchronous learning. Synchronous learning involves the exchange of ideas and information with one or more  participants during the same period. It facilitates  efficient education and provides both students and  teachers with various ways of networking and  sharing and collaborating in real-time (Higley,  2013). In e-learning environments, examples of  synchronous communication include online, realtime, live teacher instruction and feedback, Skype  conversations, chat rooms, and virtual classrooms  where  everyone  is  online  and  working collaboratively at the same time (FAO, 2011).  Asynchronous learning is self-paced and allows  participants to engage in the exchange of ideas or  information  without  depending  on  other participants’ simultaneous involvement (Boumans,  2004; Safavi, 2008). In asynchronous learning one  may use applications such as email, blogs, wikis,  discussion  boards,  web-supported  textbooks, hypertext documents, audio or video courses and  social networking using Web 2.0. Learners complete  course work, discussions, questions, et cetera in  their own time (Smith, 2009). Instructors provide materials, lectures, tests, and assignments that can be accessed at any time.  Students may be given a timeframe, usually a oneweek window, during which they need to connect at  least once or twice. However, students are free to  contribute whenever they choose (eLearners.com,  2014). In asynchronous learning, students proceed at  their own pace. If they need to listen to a lecture a  second time, or think about a question for a while,  they may do so without fear of holding back the rest  of the class (Hrastinski, 2008). Furthermore, through e-learning education is taken out of the classroom. It is therefore necessary  to determine the best e-learning method for teaching  word processing to obtain the desired results. Since  word processing provides the necessary skills for  someone to become computer literate, efforts should  be made to enhance the way in which these skills are  imparted to help students overcome the challenges  of computer illiteracy. It is worth noting that the  level at which students achieve in any subject is  directly proportional to the teaching method used,  especially in those topics that involve the acquisition  of skills (Ganyaupfu, 2013; Tejedo-Romero, Rosa,  Corcoles & Ponce, 2015). The aim of this study was to determine the effects of synchronous and  asynchronous e-learning modes on students’  cognitive  achievement  and  practical  skills acquisition in word processing to determine the best  practice in teaching word processing through  e-learning.    The Concept of E-Learning  E-learning is understood differently by different  people. However, it is generally considered as online  learning. According to Boumans (2004) e-learning  as an umbrella term describes any type of learning  that depends on or is enhanced by electronic  communication using the latest information and  communication technologies (ICT). It is also  defined as a generic term covering a wide range of  ICT technology-based applications and processes,  including computer-based learning, web-based  learning, virtual classrooms, digital collaboration  and networking (Hambrecht, 2000). Garrison and  Kanuka (2004) define e-learning as web-enabled  teaching and learning. E-learning can be defined as  learning facilitated and supported by using  information and communications technology. It can  cover a spectrum of activities, from the use of  technology to support learning as part of a blended  approach (a combination of traditional and  e-learning approaches), to learning delivered  entirely online (Jisc, 2016). E-learning encompasses several forms. In the first instance, e-learning takes the form of a means  of communication (Boumans, 2004) as it supports  communication between students, teachers, tutors or  peers. Users can share resources and co-ordinate  work processes and procedures, such as who does  what, when and how. Secondly, e-learning is used  for simulation. It is used to simulate real-world  environments, thus linking the theoretical and  practical worlds. For example, students may use  simulations to prepare themselves for practical  sessions, to reflect on and repeat specific activities,  and to simulate real-life practice in instances where  these do not exist. Thirdly, e-learning is used as a  general resource, which involves computers and  Internet-based resources and services that allow  students to learn through interactive e-learning units  and rich media sources, using speech, video,  interactive sequences or instruction. Students may  also log onto available university intranets, learning  portals or digital libraries from work or home.  Fourthly, learning management systems (LMS) can  be  used  as  e-learning  platforms.  Learning management systems software deploys, manages,  tracks and reports interactions between learners,  learning content and the teacher. Learning  management systems, in combination with learning  management content systems (LMCS) can create  content and provide storage. Learning management  content systems may serve as data repository  through which developers and subject experts may South African Journal of Education, Volume 39, Number 2, May 2019  3 share content and subject components over a  computer network. E-learning includes content (curriculum) and instruction (pedagogy). E-learning is a new  education model that may incorporate ecosystems of  networked communities and varieties of learning  resources. Safavi (2008) asserts that e-learning  emerged from two broad terms – “information  technology” and “education and training.” This  means that to transform a normal classroom lesson  into e-learning requires some expertise and  organization. In e-learning technology is a tool that  teachers may use in the new environment to impact  student learning and outcomes. When using  technology, teachers need to consider how it may  provide a solution to a specific problem in a learning  environment (Nguen, Rienties, Toetenel, Ferguson  & Whitelock, 2017). For instance, the use of  e-readers can solve the challenge of inadequate  textbooks and not understanding big ideas or  concepts, while the use of simulations can help  students working alone or in groups to see  immediate outcomes when they manipulate the  environment. Instead of just being taught theories,  learners also experience the theory, which enhances  learning and retention of knowledge (Nsa, Akpan &  Williams, 2012). Although online training is a  worthwhile approach for instruction, training  packages should not be delivered indirectly  (Rosenberg, 2001). Structure may vary, but learners’  requirements and the learning situation should  always take precedence. Rosenberg further remarks  that not all corporations are ready to deliver training  by digital means. Successful digital training depends  on support and several factors such as a culture’s  readiness and openness to comprehensively share  information, management’s readiness to invest  resources to develop robust infrastructure, and the  trainers’ readiness to design a learner-centred  curriculum based on employees’ ever-expanding  needs (Ssekakubo, Suleman & Marsden, 2011).  Moreover, these concerted efforts for e-learning  success is needed more in developing countries  where various factors militate e-learning initiatives  (Bhuasiri, Xaymoungkhoun, Zo, Rho & Ciganek,  2012).    E-Learning Application Reviews  The most direct impact of e-learning would probably  be on students’ learning achievement (Safavi, 2008).  The results from various studies show that the  complex effects are closely related to how  technology is used as an educational tool. This  shows that using technology in teaching is no simple  solution to improving learning. Kozma (2005)  reports that empirical studies on the impact of ICT  show no consistent relationship between the  availability of technology and student learning.  Kulik (2003) analysed studies to identify how  e-learning impacted student outcomes. The results show that students who used computer tutorials in  Mathematics, Natural Science and Social Science,  and those who use simulation software in Science,  score significantly higher in tests than the students  who do not use computers. The use of computerbased laboratories alone, however, did not result in  higher scores. The study further revealed that pupils  who read using tutorial software scored higher in  reading, and those who used word processors  achieved better scores in writing skills. In  comparing  asynchronous  and  synchronous e-learning effects on students, Hrastinski (2008)  asserts that asynchronous e-learning makes it  possible  for  learners  to  access  e-learning environments at any time to download documents or  respond to teachers or peers. This allows students to  spend more time refining their contributions to be  more thoughtful and productive. Synchronous  communication, on the other hand, enhances the  devotion and interest of the learner in a task. It has  been observed that e-learning resulted in lowerachieving students becoming more engaged in their  learning. In an earlier study in Kenya learners in two  randomly selected Physics classes used computerbased instruction while a third equivalent group did  not. At the end of the lessons the students who used  computers had learned physics concepts better and  were more positive about their learning of Physics  (Kulik, 2003). This corroborates Bosch’s (2009)  findings on the exploration of student’s use of  web-based learning and lecturer engagement with  students via social media. The study revealed the  positive benefits of using web-based learning –  especially in the development of educational micro  communities. Consequently, Ssekakubo et al.  (2011) who sought to determine whether e-learning  systems had fulfilled their potential in developing  countries, recommend additional research towards a  more effective deployment of learning systems.    Theoretical Framework  The theory of constructivism upholds that people’s  experiences enable them to build an understanding  and connotation of concepts (Bruner, 1990).  Applying this theory in learning suggests that when  learners acquire new information, the tendency is to  link that information to related existing information  or experience in memory, thereby forming their own  subjective mental image of the information  acquired. One of the primary goals of constructivist  theories of teaching is that students learn through  receiving training to take initiative when it comes to  their own learning experiences, instead of relying on  someone else’s information (Bruner, 1996). This  point of view corroborates that e-learning,  stimulates students’ active participation in learning  activities through electronic media. An increasing body of literature shows that students learn better when actively involved with the  curriculum  and  learning  content  through 4  Ogbonna, Ibezim, Obi technology. Teachers should thus develop curricula  that engage students with hands-on, inquiry-based  learning. Students develop higher-order thinking  and problem-solving skills by using computer-based  strategies. Students who participate in real-life  applications draw analogies, infer relationships,  predict outcomes and analyse data. E-learning has  been proven to enhance learning (Hrastinski, 2008;  Ssekakubo et al., 2011; Tang, 2002; Udofia & Udofia, 2013), however, this paper presents the comparative effects of the two e-learning methodologies  (synchronous and asynchronous) on students’ academic achievement in learning word processing.  Specifically, the study aimed to determine:  1. the effects of synchronous and asynchronous e-learn- ing on students’ cognitive achievement in word processing 2. the effects of synchronous and asynchronous e-learn- ing on students’ practical skills acquisition in word  processing 3. the influence of gender on students’ practical skills acquisition in word processing when taught through  synchronous and asynchronous e-learning. Research Questions  1. What effects do the two e-learning modes have on students’ cognitive achievement in word processing? 2. What effects do the two e-learning modes have on students’ practical skills acquisition in word processing? 3. What influence does gender have on students’ practi- cal skills acquisition when taught word processing  through synchronous and asynchronous e-learning? Hypotheses  Ho1: There is no significant difference (p > 0.05) in  students’ cognitive achievement in word processing  learnt through synchronous or asynchronous  e-learning. HA1: There is a significant difference (p > 0.05) in students’ cognitive achievement in word processing learnt through synchronous or asynchronous  e-learning. Ho2: There is no significant difference (p > 0.05) in students’ practical skills acquisition in  word processing learnt through synchronous or  asynchronous e-learning. HA2: There is no significant difference (p > 0.05) in students’ practical skills acquisition in  word processing learnt through synchronous or  asynchronous e-learning. HO3: Gender has no substantial interaction ef- fect (p > 0.05) on students’ mean cognitive achievement scores in word processing learnt through synchronous and asynchronous e-learning. HA3: Gender has a substantial interaction effect (p < 0.05) on students’ mean cognitive achievement  scores in word processing learnt through synchronous and asynchronous e-learning.    Method  The study adopted a quasi-experimental design in which preand post-tests were administered to two  non-equivalent and non-randomised groups of  students. The study was conducted in two secondary  schools in Nsukka, Enugu State, Nigeria. A sample  of 70 junior secondary school one (JSS1) students of  ages 10–12, comprising of two intact classes from  the two schools, was used for the study. Two  instruments were developed for the study: a word  processing cognitive achievement test (WPCAT)  (see Appendix A), and a word processing skill  acquisition test (WPSAT) (see Appendix C). The  WPCAT consisted of 40 multiple choice questions  with four alternative answers each. The WPSAT  consisted of five instructions. Both tests were  administered prior to the teaching intervention and  again, with the questions of the WPCAT presented  in a different order (see Appendix B), after. Every  correct answer in the WPCAT was awarded 2.5  points, while an incorrect answer was awarded no  points. Students’ level of performance was rated  according to the rating scale for the word processing  skills acquisition test (RSWPSAT) developed by the  researchers (see Appendix D). The data collection  instruments were subjected to face and content  validation. Kuder-Richardson 21 (KR-21) was used  to establish the stability of the achievement test  items, which resulted in a reliability coefficient of  0.95, while Kendall’s W Test was used to establish  the reliability of the skills acquisition, which  resulted in a coefficient of 0.94. The study was conducted during normal school lesson periods according to the class timetable for  JSS1. The regular computer studies teachers were  used to teach the learning content used in the study.  The researchers tutored these teachers on what was  expected of them during a one-day workshop. The  study involved two groups of students. Experimental  group 1 comprised of 36 students who were taught  through synchronous e-learning, and experimental  group 2 comprised of 34 students who were taught  through asynchronous e-learning. Experimental  group 1 was taught according to a synchronous  e-learning lesson plan developed by the researchers.  They received the lesson in a virtual classroom  situation, where computer systems and a multimedia  projector  were  used  as  learning  resources. Experimental group 2 used computers to access  interactive asynchronous e-learning lessons on  digital versatile discs (DVDs) as learning resources.  The students’ age and class, the lesson duration, the  specific objectives of the learning module and its  relation to the lesson topics were considered in the  preparation of the lesson plans. The content covered  in the lesson plans included the following:  definitions of word processing; uses and examples  of word processors, loading and exiting word  processor programs, retrieving, creating, formatting,  editing and saving files. The students were taught for  two lesson periods of 45 minutes per week, for three  weeks (this being the duration for teaching word South African Journal of Education, Volume 39, Number 2, May 2019  5 processing to junior secondary school one students). After the intervention the word processing cognitive achievement test (WPCAT) and the word  processing skills achievement test (WPSAT) were  once again administered by the teachers who taught  each of the groups. The researchers marked the  WPCAT scripts to obtain the students’ achievement  scores after the intervention, while the teachers used  the RSWPSAT to rate the students’ post-teaching  performance on the specific tasks/skills. The scores  collected from the two groups were analysed to  answer the research questions and test the  hypotheses. Data collected from the administration of the preand post-tests was analysed using mean (X) and  standard deviation (SD). The mean gain of each of  the groups was computed to determine the effect of  synchronous and asynchronous e-learning on  students’ achievement and skills acquisition in word  processing  studies.  To  test  the  hypotheses formulated for the study at 0.05 level of  significance, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) statistic was used.    Results  Data collected for answering the research questions  and testing the hypothesis are presented in Tables 1– 4. Data presented in Table 1 shows that the students who were taught word processing through  synchronous e-learning achieved a mean score of  47.00 in the pre-test, a mean score of 60.70 in the  post-test a gain mean score of 13.70. The data also  shows that students who were taught word  processing through the asynchronous e-learning  mode achieved a mean score of 40.81 in the pre-test,  a mean score of 66.62 in the post-test and a gain  mean score of 25.81. This result indicates that  teaching word processing using synchronous and  asynchronous e-learning appreciably increased  students’ cognitive word processing achievement.  However, students taught through asynchronous  e-learning achieved higher than the group taught  through synchronous e-learning.

Students who were taught word processing through  asynchronous e-learning achieved a pre-test skills  acquisition mean score of 30.59, a post-test skills  acquisition mean score of 53.53 and a mean skills acquisition gain score of 22.94. This result shows  that teaching word processing using synchronous  and asynchronous e-learning considerably increased  students’ practical skills acquisition in word  processing, although the students who were taught  through synchronous e-learning showed slightly  higher practical skills acquisition than the group  taught through asynchronous e-learning.

The result reveals that  male students who were taught word processing  through synchronous e-learning achieved a pre-test 6  Ogbonna, Ibezim, Obi achievement mean score of 29.72, a post-test  achievement mean score of 53.18, and an achievement mean score gain of 23.46. Female students  who were taught word processing through synchronous e-learning achieved a pre-test achievement  mean score of 30.00, an achievement mean score of  54.40, and an achievement mean score gain of  24.40. Male students who were taught word pro- cessing through asynchronous e-learning achieved a  pre-test skills acquisition mean score of 27.92, a  post-test mean skills acquisition score of 52.08, and  a skills acquisition mean gain of 24.16. Female students who were taught word processing through  asynchronous e-learning achieved a pre-test skills  acquisition mean score of 32.05, a post-test skills acquisition mean score of 54.32, and a skills acquisition mean gain of 22.27. These results indicate that  students’ gender has a slight influence on their practical skills acquisition when taught through synchronous and asynchronous e-learning. The results in Table 4 show that for the test of significant difference between the learning modes  (group), the F-cal is 1.645 and significant value is  0.204, which is a level of significance greater than 0.05. This indicates that there was no significant difference in students’ cognitive word processing  achievement scores after learning through synchronous or asynchronous e-learning. This is confirmed  by the partial eta squared value (0.024) showing a  non-significant percentage variance (2.4%) in the  dependent variable (cognitive mean achievement  test scores), which can be explained by the independent variable (learning modes). Therefore, the  null hypothesis (Ho1) was upheld. The data presented in Table 5 shows that in the test of significant difference between the learning  modes (group), F-cal is 1.558 with a significant  value of 0.216, which is greater than the 0.05 level  of significance. This indicates that there is no  significant difference in the practical skills  acquisition mean scores of the students taught  through synchronous and asynchronous e-learning.  This is confirmed by the partial eta squared value  (0.023) showing a non-significant percentage  variance (2.3%) in the dependent variable (practical  skills acquisition test scores) that can be explained  by the independent variable (learning modes).  Therefore, the null hypothesis (H02) was upheld.

Discussion  The findings of this study show that teaching word  processing through synchronous and asynchronous  e-learning modes increased the cognitive academic  achievement of students in word processing. The  data further shows that students taught through  asynchronous e-learning showed higher cognitive  achievement than those taught through synchronous  e-learning. The findings are in line with Hrastinski’s  (2008) assertion that asynchronous e-learning makes  it possible for learners to download documents or  send messages to teachers or peers at convenient  times, thereby allowing them to make thoughtful  and meaningful contributions. Garrison (2011)  opines that the significance of e-learning lies in its  ability to support communication and thinking, with  the mission to create meaning and confirm  knowledge. Furthermore, the study by Welsh,  Wanberg, Brown and Simmering (2003) shows that  self-paced learning is best done asynchronously. The findings of this study reveal that teaching word processing using synchronous and asynchronous e-learning modes considerably increased students’ practical word processing skills acquisition.  This finding concurs with those of Sife, Lwoga and  Sanga (2007) who report that e-learning provides  uniform access for both asynchronous and synchronous learning. However, the study also shows that  students taught through synchronous e-learning  achieved slightly higher practical skills acquisition  than the group taught through asynchronous e-learning. Similarly, Nsa et al. (2012) proved in their study  that a synchronous learning approach was most effective in facilitating students’ skills acquisition.  Hrastinski (2008) agrees that synchronous communication increases learners’ commitment and motivation to a task. Ruiz, Mintzer and Leipzig (2006)  reported earlier that e-learning technologies bring  about change in education by making learning  individualised, improving learners’ interaction with  others and transmuting the role of the teacher. The findings of this study show that student’s gender had a slight influence on their achievement.  This finding is supported by Nsa et al. (2012) who  assert that any change in instructional strategies can  produce a minor difference on male and female  students’ skills acquisition. The findings in this study show that there is no significant difference in students’ scores in the word  processing cognitive achievement test and the practical skills acquisition taught through synchronous  or asynchronous e-learning. Furthermore, the study  reveals that no significant interaction effect exists  between student’s gender and the learning modes regarding practical word processing skills acquisition  mean scores. This finding implies that gender in  combination with e-learning modes does not affect  students’ skills acquisition in word processing. This  result concurs with the findings by Ibe (2004, in  Nwagbo & Chukelu, 2011) and Iloputaife (2001)  who found no significant interaction between instructional method and gender on performance.    Recommendations  1. Teachers  should  be  encouraged  by  school administrators to adopt the use of these modes for  effective instructional delivery in word processing. 2. Seminars, workshops and conferences on the use and application of synchronous and asynchronous elearning modes for effective teaching and learning in  schools should be arranged for teachers by  educational administrators and the Ministry of  Education. 3. School administrators and stakeholders should provide functional technologies that would enable  teachers to utilise these e-learning modes. Conclusion  Word processing is among the first skills  applications taught in schools or learnt by  individuals  for  computer  literacy.  Through e-learning a wide audience of learners gain access to  education through asynchronous and synchronous  learning modes. Since computer literacy for all has  become important in the globalised world, and  e-learning has proven to be an effective medium of  reaching the educationally unreached, it was  imperative to determine the most effective  e-learning mode for such a fundamental course as  word processing. Hence, this study was carried out  to investigate the effects of synchronous and  asynchronous e-learning modes on students’  achievement and skills acquisition in word  processing. Based on the data collected and  analysed, the study found that both synchronous and  asynchronous  e-learning  modes  significantly 8  Ogbonna, Ibezim, Obi increased  students’  achievement  and  skills acquisition in word processing, irrespective of the  students’ gender. However, students taught through  asynchronous e-learning showed higher cognitive  achievement,  while  students  taught  through synchronous e-learning achieved better skills  acquisition. A major limitation of the study was the  low extent of practical word processing skills rated  due to the school curriculum and level of the student  participants used in the study. Nevertheless, the  comparisons to other studies offer an extent of  credibility to the findings. Moreover, further  research can focus on learners who possess deeper  cognitive and practical skills in word processing at  higher educational levels.    Authors’ Contributions  Chinyere Ogbonna collected and analysed the data,  Nnenna Ibezim supervised the data collection,  analysed data for tests of significance and wrote the  manuscript, and Chiaka Obi co-supervised the data  collection and edited the research methodology.
