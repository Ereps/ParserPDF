Binus Business Review, 12(1), 41-51. https://doi. org/10.21512/bbr.v12i1.6419 ABSTRACT The digital era, which increasingly becomes massive in people’s lives, impacts the traditional sales methods.  E-commerce companies compete in winning the competition to create superior customer value. An effective and  efficient marketing strategy is needed that can influence customer purchase intention. The research focused on  the effect of customer satisfaction, which created eWOM and increased brand equity on purchase intention by  adding culture (collectivist culture) as the moderator variables. The research applied a quantitative approach. The  data were obtained from 280 respondents selected by non-probability sampling. Respondents were customers  who had already bought products through e-commerce in Indonesia. The questionnaire instrument was adopted  based on theories from the previous researchers. The data used the Likert scale and were analyzed using the  SmartPLS 3.0. The results state a significant relationship between the independent and dependent variables. All  independent variables have a significant influence on the dependent variable. However, culture as the moderator  variable cannot get significant results in the relationship between all the variables. It gets irrelevant results. Hence,  the results show that the moderator variable is more appropriate as the independent variable. It can directly  affect purchase intention. The research contributes to testing culture as the moderator variable that makes the  independent variables generalize the findings. Keywords: customer satisfaction, electronic word of mouth (eWOM), brand equity, e-commerce, purchase  intention, collectivist culture INTRODUCTION Historically, the efforts made by the company have focused on customer satisfaction. It will impact  customer involvement (engagement). The higher the  satisfaction is, the more the customers will voluntarily  help to spread information about the online shopping  experience. It is commonly called electronic word  of mouth (eWOM) (Thakur, 2019). It is a useful  interpersonal communication tool. It is proven to  affect other customers’ purchase intentions. Therefore,  proper management of eWOM is a significant issue  in creating a brand in customers’ minds (Zhang,  Liang, & Qi, 2021). Customers conduct it, such as discussing the quality and product reviews (Tandon,  Aakash, & Aggarwal, 2020). Because information of  eWOM comes from direct customers, not from the  companies, this communication is very influential on  online shoppers because they are informal, exchange  feedback, and give personal information. It is beneficial  compared to formal communication (Hidayanto,  Ovirza, Anggia, Budi, & Phusavat, 2017). It has been  recognized as one of the most influential resources in  the information. It impacts customers because the easy  and accessible information can significantly influence  consumption decisions (Olmedilla, Martínez-Torres,  & Toral, 2019). It can also influence brand image and  purchase intention in a company. Marketers can use 42 Binus Business Review, Vol. 12 No. 1, March 2021, 41-51 online platforms to make customers quickly see and  choose products (Krishnamurthy & Kumar, 2018) Online shopping refers to buying and selling products and services through the Internet in  e-commerce (Turban, Whiteside, King, & Outland,  2017). Indonesians are very familiar with the  existence of e-commerce in online shopping. Some  of Indonesia’s largest e-commerce companies include  Tokopedia, Shopee, Bukalapak, Lazada, Blibli, and  JD.id (iPrice, 2020). The high competition between  e-commerce companies demands the companies to  create better customer value than their competitors.  However, the existing culture in an area can affect  marketing communications. The previous research  shows that when managers formulate online  advertising and brand strategies, they must consider  each country’s different cultural dimensions. The  failure rate of an online strategy will be lower if more  and more e-commerce companies know a country’s  cultural values   (Valaei, Rezaei, Ismail, & Oh, 2016). Indonesian culture, which tends to be collectivist, causes differences in marketing communication styles  compared to other countries (Haryanto, Moutinho, &  Coelho, 2016; Wijaya, Wahyudi, Kusuma, & Sugianto,  2018). They perceive themselves as a part of other  people and tend to follow social norms. It is different  from individualist culture that is selfish and disregards  others’ opinions (Luo, Wu, Shi, & Xu, 2014). The  importance of using eWOM communication in  influencing customers with collectivist culture can  affect their purchase intention (Levy & Gvili, 2020;  Yan et al., 2016) Customer satisfaction is the most critical issue for online and offline companies in increasing  sales (Hult, Sharma, Morgeson, & Zhang, 2019). It  is an emotional response of approval when getting  satisfactory results and as an alternative when getting  dissatisfied results (Cheng, Gan, Imrie, & Mansori,  2018). It is a task for marketers to realize between  customers’ perceptions with marketing methods that  are interpreted in various ways. Success in a company’s  long-term competitiveness is closely related to  customer satisfaction. There is a relationship between  customer satisfaction with customer relations. In the  traditional understanding of the product or customer  perception in quality related to service, it can be  broadened to three aspects: the perspective related to  the competition must be added, the level of customer  involvement must be considered, and the perception  in quality must be differentiated based on changes in  customers’ internal expectation standards (HennigThurau & Klee, 1997). In measuring the performance of eWOM, the researchers can use several indicators such  as information quality, trustworthiness, loyalty,  satisfaction, social relations, source quality, a quantity  of information, and subjective norms (Sijoria,  Mukherjee, & Datta, 2019). The previous research  shows that the characteristics of information, consumer  behavior, and technological factors positively influence  purchase intentions. The involvement of eWOM also has a significant effect. The eWOM involvement has  a significant positive effect on purchase intentions.  However, not all measured indicators have positive  impacts, such as information quality and social support  (Yusuf, Che Hussin, & Busalim, 2018). When the customers are satisfied, they will consciously intend to share the information regarding  the product (Fu, Ju, & Hsu, 2015). The existence of  eWOM communication conducted by customers  based on their experience can shape the brand image  (Sijoria et al., 2019). However, in practice, eWOM  communication does not always go according to what  is desired by the company, namely, the occurrence  of positive eWOM. Negative eWOM can also occur  when customers’ expectations do not match the  reality in the form of received goods or services. The  frustrated consumer behavior leads to negative eWOM  associated with reduced purchases and decreased  trust in the brand (Azemi, Ozuem, & Howell, 2020).  Companies must anticipate the negative eWOM by  quickly responding to these customers (Lee, Rodgers,  & Kim, 2009). Then, the researchers propose the  following hypothesis: H1 :  Customer satisfaction has a significant effect on eWOM H2 :  EWOM has a significant effect on brand equity Companies must provide relevant information, content, and website design to attract attention to  build positive eWOM. When the positive eWOM  occurs, it means that the customers are satisfied with  their experience. Then, it will lead to the purchase  intention of those customers to repurchase or someone  else who sees the eWOM distribution (Aslam, Farhat,  & Arif, 2019). The eWOM has a positive effect on  repurchase intentions and perceived value. At the same  time, eWOM negatively affects perceived risk. The  customers tend to look for information directly from  experiences that match what they want to buy (Liang,  Choi, & Joppe, 2018). When the proportion of negative  online reviews increases, it will affect the customers’  attitudes in choosing a product. However, not all  products, such as popular products, are influenced by  negative reviews. Otherwise, an unpopular product  will decrease purchase intentions (Shihab & Putri,  2019). Companies must encourage customers to  spread eWOM positively through excellent products  and services (Ismagilova, Slade, Rana, & Dwivedi,  2020). Hence, the proposed hypotheses are: H3 :  Customer satisfaction has a significant effect on purchase intentions H4 : EWOM has a significant effect on purchase intentions The increasing competition requires a unique feature that must be displayed differently to be a special  attraction. It is called brand equity. It is an added  value given to a product by considering customers’ 43 The Impact of Customer Satisfaction ..... (Angga Febrian; Muhtad Fadly) thoughts, words, and actions (Keller & Brexendorf,  2019). Companies can build their products and  services by connecting brands with other entities so  customers can feel and act in thinking about brands  (Keller, 2020). Five factors in brand equity are brand  loyalty, brand awareness, brand quality perception,  brand associations, and other exclusive brand assets.  Customer trust in the excellent brand in the form of  good service, customer satisfaction, and the reputation  of the e-commerce company will influence purchase  intentions (Oliveira, Alhinho, Rita, & Dhillon, 2017). Moreover, e-commerce platforms are essential because they contain information about products,  brands, and services that meet customers’ needs  (Al-Dwairi, Harb, & Shehabat, 2020). Marketing in  e-commerce depends on how marketers can measure  customer satisfaction that can affect brand equity  (Nasiruddin & Hashim, 2015). Brand equity becomes  essential because it can influence positive attitudes that  can manifest in consumer behavior, such as purchase  intentions (Bae, Jung, Moorhouse, Suh, & Kwon,  2020; Civelek & Ertemel, 2019). In  studying  consumer  behavior,  some researchers use the Theory of Planned Behavior in  predicting someone’s purchase intention. It is assumed  that intention can influence behavior. The more  influential the intention is, the more likely a person will  do it (Amaro & Duarte, 2015). Attitudes, subjective  norms, and behavior control are used in measuring  intentions in the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen,  1985). Trust in the brand is believed to affect purchase  intentions positively. It ultimately positively impacts  buying behavior. Then, the researchers propose the  next hypothesis as follows: H5 :  Brand equity has a significant effect on purchase intentions Although previous studies have shown the results of eWOM and brand equity affect purchase  intentions (Alrwashdeh, Emeagwali, & Aljuhmani,  2019; Febrian & Vinahapsari, 2020), they cannot be  generalized when applying the method in a crosscultural manner. Many previous studies have examined  the direct effect of eWOM on purchase intentions and  must see the effects of moderation comprehensively  (Ismagilova, Dwivedi, & Slade, 2019). There is  a need for culture as the moderator variable in  generating results (Alrwashdeh et al., 2019; Nuseir,  2019). Cultural characteristics are divided into power  distance,  individualism/collectivism,  masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation  (Hofstede, 1986). However, the researchers focus  on the collectivist culture because previous studies  indicate that Indonesian culture tends to be directed  towards this cultural characteristic (Haryanto et al.,  2016; Wijaya et al., 2018). For example, a region that  has collectivist culture will interact a lot compared to  individualism. Other people’s opinions become very  influential in the collectivist culture. Conversely,  people who tend to be individualistic will pay less attention to others’ opinions (Roberts, Jadalla, JonesOyefeso, Winslow, & Taylor, 2017). Within the scope  of a business, participation and user interaction are  used to establish good company relationships. The  cultural dimension of individualism/collectivism will  significantly influence user behavior (Arpaci, Baloğlu,  & Kesici, 2018). When there is recognition from other people on an excellent e-commerce brand, it will influence  customers to purchase. It will strengthen and accelerate  the growth of recognition of the quality of e-commerce  (Atmojo, Budiastuti, Abbas, & Kosala, 2019). Another  previous research also proves that the collectivist  culture in Indonesia strengthens the influence of  relevant information about customer satisfaction with  online purchases in e-commerce. A high collectivist  culture affects Indonesian customers to be more  tolerant about the lack of ease of use and guarantee  of their privacy when making online purchases (Jauw  & Purwanto, 2017). In terms of e-commerce service  providers, a good understanding of the characteristics  of collectivist culture in Indonesia can help to meet  customers’ needs (Arinalhaq & Widyanti, 2019). The  culture between Indonesia and other countries may be  different. Based on previous research limitations, it is  necessary to add culture as a moderator by looking at  positive experiences. Therefore, the other hypotheses  are: H6a :  Culture moderates the relationship between customer satisfaction and purchase intention H6b: Culture moderates the relationship between eWOM and purchase intention H6c : Culture moderates the relationship between brand equity and purchase intention The research proposes a model to examine the involvement of eWOM in e-commerce by looking at  cultural factors as the moderating variable. Hence, it  can influence purchase intentions through a theory of  reason action and involve brand equity. This model  shows that eWOM marketing communication looks  at it from the perspective of forming its eWOM  and variables to explain eWOM phenomena in  e-commerce. Figure 1 shows the research model. Figure 1 Research Model 44 Binus Business Review, Vol. 12 No. 1, March 2021, 41-51 METHODS The quantitative approach is applied in analyzing the obtained statistical data from 280  respondents. They are selected by non-probability  sampling. The respondents are customers who have  already bought products through e-commerce in  Indonesia. The data collection through questionnaires  uses Likert scale measurement from one (strongly  disagree) to five (strongly agree). The questionnaire  instrument is adopted based on theories from the  previous researchers, such as satisfaction (Hew, Lee,  Ooi, & Lin, 2016), eWOM (Sijoria et al., 2019), brand  equity (Beig & Nika, 2019), culture (Nguyen, Lobo,  & Greenland, 2017; Sreen, Purbey, & Sadarangani,  2018), and purchase intention (Akar & Dalgic, 2018;  Chiu, Kim, & Won, 2018). The Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) is used to validate the research  model. This method is chosen because of its ability to  test the relationship between the most comprehensive  constructs with many measurement items (Henseler,  2017). There are two steps to evaluate the model in  PLS-SEM. First, the researchers examine measurement  models, such as reliability, convergent validity, and  discriminant validity. Second, the researchers look  at the explanatory value of the model, focus on the  significance and relevance of the path coefficients,  and examine the structural model (Sarstedt & Cheah,  2019). RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS Table 1 The Demographics of Respondents Category Total Gender Male 90 Female 190 Age 17−25 years 226 26−35 years 35 36−45 years 14 > 46 years 5 Education Senior high school 205 Bachelor degree 37 Master degree 38 E-commerce Lazada 10 Bukalapak 9 Shopee 137 Tokopedia 124 Data in Table 1 are collected by taking various characteristics of the respondents. Based on the result,  there are more female respondents than that male.  Women tend to shop through e-commerce. Moreover,  the respondents are dominated by millennials (17 to  25 years) who have graduated from high school. The data also show that the dominating e-commerce brand  is Shopee. It is in line with the data presented by iPrice  (2020), stating that Shopee was in the top rank in 2020. The reliability and validity of the model are tested to see Cronbach’s alpha, Average Variance Extracted  (AVE), and composite reliability. Convergent validity  shows that the various observed variables from one  latent construct are related to each other. The results  can be seen in Table 2. According to the required value,  all constructs have good values  with higher AVE and  composite reliability than 0,50 and 0,70, respectively.  Cronbach’s alpha values  range from 0,775 to 1,000. It  indicates that all constructs have good results because  they are higher than the recommended Cronbach’s  alpha with a minimum of 0,7 (Hair, Risher, Sarstedt,  & Ringle, 2019). Evaluation models are examined and have good results in reliability and validity. The regression  analysis estimates the relationship between constructs.  The researchers examine the direct effects of  independent, dependent, and moderator variables.  To test the structural models and hypotheses, the  researchers use SmartPLS version 3.0. In Table 3 (see  Appendices), the results of the relationship between  variables are explained. The items have a good  measurement because they match the required value  (> 0,7). Table 2 The Result of Reliability and Validity Tests Construct Cronbach’s Alpha Composite  Reliability AVE Brand Equity 0,940 0,947 0,563 Culture 0,771 0,845 0,523 Purchase  Intention 0,856 0,891 0,541 Moderator  Effect 1 1,000 1,000 1,000 Moderator  Effect 2 1,000 1,000 1,000 Moderator  Effect 3 1,000 1,000 1,000 Customer  Satisfaction 0,755 0,843 0,554 EWOM 0,963 0,966 0,539 The results will show a significant direct effect if the t-value is higher than 1,96, and the p-value is  smaller than 0,05. Table 4 (see Appendices) shows the  results of the hypothesis test. H1 predicts the effect  of customer satisfaction on the formation of eWOM.  Customer satisfaction significantly influences eWOM  with t-value of 24,305 and p-value of 0,000. H1 is  accepted. There is consistency with previous research  models based on satisfaction (Leung, 2020; Sijoria et  al., 2019). Companies must encourage customers to  talk about their satisfying experiences (Anastasiei &  Dospinescu, 2019). 45 The Impact of Customer Satisfaction ..... (Angga Febrian; Muhtad Fadly) For H2, it is regarding the effect of eWOM on brand equity. EWOM significantly influences the  increase in brand equity with the t-value of 39,848  and the p-value of 0,000. H2 is accepted. These results  support previous research, which states a significant  relationship between the two variables. When there is  positive eWOM, there will be an increase in a brand  image (Aslam et al., 2019; Godey et al., 2016; Sijoria  et al., 2019). In H3, it predicts the effect of customer satisfaction on purchase intention. The result shows  the t-value of 2,259 and the p-value of 0,024. It  implies that customer satisfaction significantly  affects purchase intention. H3 is accepted. The result  supports the previous research by (Bulut, 2015;  Tandon et al., 2020). When customers are satisfied  with the e-commerce website in making a purchase,  their purchase intentions will increase. Customers are  satisfied when e-commerce can be trusted and respond  to their messages and complaints quickly. E-commerce  should give a good impression and satisfy the  customers. Meanwhile, the result is not significant in  H6a, which predicts that the relationship of customer  satisfaction and purchase intention moderated by  culture. The result shows path coefficients of 0,443. In  Table 4 (see Appendices), it illustrates the insignificant  relationship. The p-value of 0,658 is higher than 0,05.  Thus, H6a is not supported. Moreover, H4 predicts the effect of eWOM on purchase intention. The results show that eWOM has  a significant effect on customer purchase intention. It  is with the t-value of 2,245 and the p-value of 0,025.  The result is in line with the previous research, which  shows that customers with a strong affinity for positive  eWOM will tend to have a greater repurchase intention   (Aslam et al., 2019; Yusuf et al., 2018). Meanwhile,  in H6b, it has an irrelevant result with the t-value  of 1,423 and the p-value of 0,155. It cannot predict  the relationship of eWOM and purchase intention  moderated by culture. H6b is rejected. Next, H5 predicts the effect of brand equity on purchase intention. The result shows a significant  effect of brand equity on purchase intention. It is with  the t-value of 5,237 and the p-value of 0,000. The result  is similar to previous research (Chiu & Cho, 2019;  Febrian & Vinahapsari, 2020; Lee, Siu, & Zhang,  2020). The higher the value of a brand is, the easier it  will be to influence customers in the attitude towards  the brand. For H6c, the result is not significant, with  the t-value of 1,171 and the p-value of 0,242. It cannot  show the relationship of brand equity and purchase  intention moderated by culture. H6c is not supported. The results find that all independent variables have a significant influence on the dependent variable.  Culture as the moderator variable can not get significant  results in the relationship between all the variables.  However, it can directly affect purchase intention. The  research has the same results from previous research,  which states that culture cannot be used as a moderator  variable (Lee, 2017). Table 5 (see Appendices) shows a grouping of results from the moderator variable (Sharma, Durand,  & Gur-Arie,  1981). In the first category, there are no  interactions with the independent variable. However,  there is an interaction with the dependent variable.  This category has an additional predictor, intervening,  exogenous, antecedent, or suppressor variable. The  second category explains that there is no interaction  with the independent and dependent variables. It is  called homologies moderator. In the third category,  there is a relationship between the two variables. It is  called a quasi moderator. The fourth category explains  that there is no relationship to the dependent variables.  However, there is a relationship to the independent  variables. It is called a pure moderator. Related  to the moderator value results, although there are  insignificant values  of the culture as the moderator, it   as a variable has a significant p-value of 0,000. Then,  culture can be an intervening, exogenous, antecedent,  suppressor, or predictor variable in the relationship. From a theoretical perspective, the research has produced some progress. First, it is related to a  holistic approach to online shopping in e-commerce. It  integrates several theoretical models that can be used  to study consumer behavior. Furthermore, the research  shows the complexity of several integrated theories  into effective communication by adding relevant  constructs so that eWOM becomes an essential  predictor of shopping attitudes in e-commerce. Each  dimension in forming a variable contributes well to  what is discussed in the literature. Second, in general, the variable that functions as a moderator can be seen from the extent to which  it can explain the relationship between independent  and dependent variables. The culture as the moderator  variable gets irrelevant results in connecting  independent and dependent variables. However, it has  a significant value on purchase intention. It does not  act as a moderator in the context of online purchases.  It can be an exogenous variable that directly  influences purchase intention. The research seeks to  meet previous research limitations, which states that  culture is needed by looking at marketing strategies  comprehensively (Alrwashdeh et al., 2019; Ismagilova  et al., 2020; Nuseir, 2019). The results state that  culture can be used as an independent or exogenous  variable in online purchase studies. These results are  supported by previous research that the collectivist  culture, which considers the opinions of others in  making decisions, can be an antecedent variable to  purchase intention (Aliyev & Wagner, 2018; RosilloDíaz, Blanco-Encomienda, & Crespo-Almendros,  2019; Watanabe, Torres, & Alfinito, 2019). For practical implication, online shopping is massive in the digital era, which makes e-commerce  companies have to be superior to their competitors.  Customer satisfaction is the companies’ primary goal  because it increases the repurchase intention. It can  also influence customers to recommend the products  to others through social media and features provided  by e-commerce. It is beneficial for increasing the  companies’ brand equity. EWOM communication 46 Binus Business Review, Vol. 12 No. 1, March 2021, 41-51 strategy is proven to affect purchase intentions  because customers trust the stories of other customers  who have shopping experience in e-commerce  compared to provided information by the companies.  Before making a purchase, the customers tend to see  other customers’ reviews regarding the same product  in e-commerce. In the end, the research looks at the  process when customers get reliable information.  They will be involved in the formation of eWOM by  sharing information and finding information through  eWOM. Companies must encourage more customers  to do eWOM to build brand credibility. Another exciting result is the need for the addition of cultural factors in seeing an effective marketing  strategy. The research focuses on the collectivist  culture in Indonesia. E-commerce companies must  consider cultural factors in influencing purchase  intentions because each country has a different culture.  Hence, it will also differ in how to approach it. The  collectivist culture dimension can be the company’s  new focus in establishing communication between  buyers and sellers in Indonesia. In a collectivist  culture, customers are more easily influenced by  others who become figures in the community. It will  be an appropriate strategy for companies to use these  figures as an eWOM communication tool. CONCLUSIONS The research focuses on the effect of customer satisfaction with eWOM and brand equity on  increasing purchase intention by adding culture as  the moderator variables. The researchers find that all  independent variables have a significant influence  on the dependent variable. However, culture as the  moderator variable can not get significant results in the  relationship between all the variables. On the contrary,  it can directly affect purchase intention. Although the research finds in-depth results on marketing theory, it has three limitations. First,  in sampling, the research does not look at age  differences, considering that not only young customers  are shopping online, but also from some age groups.  Then, the age factor or cohort generation can be used  as a reference in selecting respondents for further  research. Second, the research only uses collectivist  culture factors in Indonesia. It may have different  results if it is applied in collectivist culture in other  countries. To generalize the findings, the researchers  recommend the future researchers to compare the  results with other countries having similarities with  Indonesia. The research states that culture can be used  as an independent variable in influencing purchase  intention. Then, it can be used for further research.  Third, because of Indonesia’s cultural trends, public  figures greatly influence purchase intentions. For  further research, celebrity endorsement variable can  be used to support the marketing of eWOM.
