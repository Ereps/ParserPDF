The proposed research explored the mediating effect of supply  chain risk in the logistics and distribution industry, providing unique insights for future research,  literature, and targeted sectors. A descriptive, causal and analytical design with quantitative  research technique was applied to the proposed research model. A sample of 301 respondents from  the managerial departments of 176 logistics and distribution companies in Dubai and Abu Dhabi  was used to assess the research variables. The findings revealed that the impact of information  systems was positively associated with the e-supply chain, while the indirect impact of supply  chain risk significantly positively impacted the e-supply chain. The research is limited to assessing  the supply chain risk as an intermediary. For future research, exploring the SC risk prevention  strategies' impact on the E-supply chain is recommended. Research findings are anticipated to  assist communities of practice in making better information security decisions in the context of esupply chain by clearly implementing information security policies internally and externally to  enhance e-supply chain performance and SC risk management.  © 202  3 Growing Science Ltd.

Introduction  Implementing information system technologies in organisations seems to manage functions worldwide in the technological  era. It helps in improving the information within the firms and between the partners of the supply chain processes (Gölgeci,  & Ponomarov, 2015). This secure sharing helps in the demand for information in the supply chain that can enhance the  performance of the supply chain processes and overcome the issues that can increase the availability and reduce the inventory  management-related costs (Attaran, 2007; Kurdi et al., 2022). Additionally, certain risks may arise for the entire industry (  Hamadneh et al., 2021). Such risks could occur due to new technologies disrupting the whole market or a new competitor  with a similar business model within the same industry (Kumar et al., 2019; Lee, Azmi, et al., 2022a; Shamout et al., 2022).  The procedure of moving products around the globe is a lengthy and difficult process. Managers are still unaware of the  necessary steps to improve their logistics security programmes in light of new difficulties in managing the efficiency of the  e-supply chain (Alshurideh et al., 2022; Joghee et al., 2021). Without compromising supply chain effectiveness, the security  concerns of manufacturers and transportation businesses must be addressed. Information security in the e-supply chain is  necessary at each process segment (Lee, Romzi, et al., 2022b; Rafati, 2022). The logistics and distribution industry must  consider the criteria to enhance technology adoption practices (Falasca et al., 2008; Sindhuja, 2014). In the era of technology  and home delivery, companies have become more aware of safe delivery. 146 This research provides a model of supply chain risk that captures both the source of assaults and the e-supply chain activities  and links susceptible to information technology threats in the logistics and distribution industry of the UAE. Even though  suppliers in several tiers and different countries are fully coordinated to reduce the overall supply chain cost, significant risks  and problems in global business operations could disrupt the global supply chain. Therefore, this research will incorporate  the important factors that can help observe the risk and the organization's attempt to prevent these risks to competitiveness.     2. Theoretical framework   2.1 Information Security  Information security can be defined in terms of technical, formal, and informal levels. A technical level: First, let us discuss  how well we can do this. Information security controls in computer systems include speech analysis, firewalls, digital  signatures, and other methods to protect software, devices, and data within the computer system (Salloum et al., 2020). All  of these methods are used to protect the applications of software, devices, and data that are within the computer system itself.  Second, at the formal level, official controls are established based on rules that state how the published technical controls  should be structured. At the informal level, the issue is how to keep information secure within an organization’s structure  (Kunnathur & Vaithianathan, 2008). A successful enterprise must protect its valuable information assets, such as its IT  systems and networks (Cheung et al., 2021). Regarding e-commerce, many people assume that information technology  security is a relatively new concept that has only been developed during this period.     2.2 E-Supply Chain    Supply chain specialists refer to electronic business processes in the supply chain as “e-Supply Chain” by supply chain  specialists. This term entails any activity using electronic business operations across the supply chain. In the context of  supply chain, E-supply chain management refers to using e-business technology to help and improve value-adding processes  (Kumar et al., 2019). The use of technology to enhance business-to-business operations and make them quicker, more flexible  and simpler to regulate is another definition of e-supply chain management described by (Chu et al., 2020). He continues: It  also has the additional benefit of increasing client happiness. The development of supply chain management (e-SCM) entails  more than simply technological developments. Supply chain management is concerned with changes in management policies,  performance metrics, business processes, and organizational structures at all levels of the supply chain (Angerhofer &   Angelides, 2006).   2.3 Supply Chain Risk  When new market trends like just-in-time (JIT) and significant non-core activities like supplier rationalization programs are  implemented, the supply chain may become more vulnerable due to dispersion, centralization and globalization of the supply  chain's components. Due to the risk of influencing performance, we should control it (Kumar et al., 2019). Furthermore, the  risk may include a scenario in which an extremely unusual event occurs, with adverse consequences for the company. Supply  chain risk may be defined in terms of the rate at which a potential outcome has an effect and its vulnerability to the impact.  Specifically, risk refers to the unpredictability of an occurrence that has the potential to interrupt a single link in the E-supply  chain and, as a consequence, influence the company's ability to achieve its objectives (Heckmann et al., 2015). This kind of  risk is sometimes referred to as ë-supply chain volatility," which entails the potential of reducing value added at any point  along the supply chain's journey due to changes in the amount or quality of commodities at any given point in time or location  (Kumar et al., 2019). To minimize internal and external losses, a company's supply chain risk management strategy must be  carefully and properly crafted and maintained. Some academics argue that resources for supply chain risk management  should be increased. Others conducted a study involving various organizations and discovered that insufficient contingency  planning was one of the primary reasons for supply chain interruptions (Gurtu & Johny, 2021).    2.4 Operational Definitions 2.5 Industry Description    The UAE is an attractive market for retailers due to government-led economic reforms, a wide and digitally connected  millennial customer sector with extensive spending power. The contribution of wholesale and retail trade to Dubai's GDP is Variables  Definition  Reference Information Security  Information security safeguards sensitive data against unauthorized access,  modification, recording, disruption, or destruction. The goal is to ensure the security  and privacy of critical data, including financial information, customer account  information, and intellectual property. (Cheung et al., 2021) Supply Chain Risk  SC risk refers to a collection of approaches, tactics, and strategies for mitigating the  supply chain's susceptibility. Improved supply chain risk management (SCRM)  practices may contribute to the development of resilience. (Can Saglam et al., 2020) E-Supply Chain  Business operations that integrate e-business strategies with supply chain processes  are referred to as e-Supply Chain. Chain management for e-supplies includes  utilizing e-business technologies to facilitate and maximise value-adding supply  chain operations. (Aloqool et al., 2022) M. T. Alshurideh et al.   /Uncertain Supply Chain Management 11 (2023)   147 26.4 per cent, and the GDP of the UAE as a whole is approximately 11 per cent. Many companies aim to make the UAE one  of the key markets for their products to take advantage of this dynamic market. Selecting a distributor for your items is one  of the trading firms' most efficient operational structures. A distributor is in charge of the channel mix, product availability,  and visibility, promoting purchasing your goods through various channels in the area. Distributors are typically regarded as  the product's proprietors for the designated region. This industry is involved with extensive information of implementing  information security and the criteria for e-supply chain by considering supply chain risk overall.     3. Literature review   3.1 The relationship and impact of information security on supply chain risk     The impact of information security on the e-supply chain defines the evolution of supply-chain processes over the last few  years that are largely driven by technology. The companies move towards digital management that can compel the disruptions  within previous years' services. Therefore, businesses are allowed to build the options of cyber security fortresses for their  success in the market. Different vulnerabilities are used to define the touch points that can help the manufacturers, supplier  services, global management of partners, and different service providers. The potential threats arise within the parties waiting  to breach security for getting the initial chance. Cyber security is considered a mature action to a definite extent that can  manage larger enterprises and focuses on implementing the perimeter within the organisation. There is a lack of governance  and control over the management of individual departments dealing with identifying the related entities within the ecosystem  (Hunitie et al., 2022; Qi et al., 2022). Several smaller businesses are considering the lower match for the implementation of  the strengths of cyber security. The processes provide favourable impacts to the entry points for the definite hackers. Different  supply chain information security (SCIS) issues are neither discussed in detail nor received the appropriate attention. The  companies use a framework for bringing out certain issues for the enfolding of SCIS (Bolhari, 2009). There is a definite  adoption by businesses as considering the complex management of the operations that can impact the processes efficiently.  The experts point out that organisations are considering the least evaluation management and describing the potential  possibilities of using blockchain analysis. Therefore, the organisations are responsible for implementing the corporate-wide  vision for the data-access guidelines and related standards. It defines the sensitive data that can be shared within the services  to manage the potential server and network audits. It will help maintain a good trail for special and admin services. The  experts in the e-supply chain seem to promote the idea of defining the breach for the occurrence of a cyber-resilience plan as  essential (Bolhari, 2009). There must be a broader framework that can support different sizes of businesses while measuring  the e-supply-chain cyber security management. Based on previous literature, a hypothesised model can be supported in this  research.    H1: Information system has a significant impact on supply chain risk.    3.2 The relationship and impact of information security on the e-supply chain     Information Technology has become a vital component in supply chain collaborations due to its ability to process the huge  amount of data and information needed to manage the processes, leading to a maximized efficiency for all participating  members within the supply chain commands (Demeter & Gelei, 2004). Defining supply chain risk is critical to measuring  and defining information security's effect. Supply chain risk is described as the potential for a failure to satisfy consumer  needs if an incident or accident affects the movement of products from suppliers to markets. Manufacturing processes,  control, demand, supply, and the environment are the key contributors to supply chain risk. The organization, network, and  environment contribute to data collection (Pournader et al., 2020).    First, the organization’s risks can include issues with labor, production disruptions, IT systems, processes, warehousing,  transportation, planning and scheduling. Additionally, network risks include unexpected situations in the employment and  transportation of goods and services. Lastly, environmental risks are defined by accidents and socio-political actions  impacting the supply and demand risks in the organization and network levels. In March and April of 2021, an employee's  negligence caused massive data loss to the city of Dallas Police Department. The employee erased 8.7 million main police  files collected as evidence for cases where the family violence unit owned most files. The prevention of such threats is the  responsibility of the managers who can provide awareness to employees due to the important role played by information  security awareness and knowledge. Moreover, plans, procedures and policies set in the right manner are proven to be vital  in minimizing threats caused by employees within the organization (Bolhari, 2009). Virus, Browser Hijackers, Worm,  Trojans, and Keyloggers are examples of external threats. To elaborate more, Keyloggers are programs that record users'  keystrokes, including personal information and passwords. Browser Hijackers are programs that gather information on users'  online habits every time they begin browsing. Literature suggests a significant relationship between information systems (IT)  and the E-supply chain. The evidenced information is considered for this research's proposed hypothesis.     H2: Information system has a significant impact on the E-supply chain. 148 3.3 The relationship and impact of supply chain risk on the e-supply chain      Due to globalization, international business, short product life cycles, and variation in consumer demand and requirements,  risks in supply chain activities have risen in recent years. Such disruptions cause sudden and unanticipated failures that  natural disasters may also cause, fire loss, lack of supplier power, war, terrorism and so on, “involuntary loss of specific  assets due to events caused by factors that are outside the government’s control and is mostly political” (Rajesh & Ravi,  2015). These risks are divided into categories which are divided into subcategories. This includes the risk of delays, incorrect  forecasting, faulty systems, procurement and purchasing teams, and minimal inventory and capacity. The two main categories  of risk faced by e-supply chains are divided into two factors: internal and external. The internal risk factors include internal  faults such as delays in information flow throughout the supply chain or slow communication between the parties (Chu et  al., 2020). For instance, the parties involved within the supply chain are exposed to inaccurate information due to  misunderstandings. This can cause a risk. Moreover, customs regulations are considered as an internal risk and capacity  variation. On the other hand, external factors include the threat of competition and market competitors, the prices within the  market, "competitive pricing", and how competitors usually price their products. Furthermore, supplier quality is another  risk factor that affects the e-supply chain (Baabdullah et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020). As discussed in Porter's five  competitive forces, supplier quality can be a major issue whether you have the best quality product/service within the market  or not. Besides the list, manufacturing costs and political/economical/technological and legal issues are considered risk  factors affecting the e-supply chain industry. Risks often occur due to the inconsistent balance between supply and demand  and random interruptions to the normal activities within the e-supply chain. The risks of the supply chain impacting the esupply chain are reflected in the diagram below. Fig. 1 shows the relationship of the impact of both variables (Kumar et al.,  2019; Pournader et al., 2020).  Fig. 1. E-Supply Chain Risk Model The above risks are the related risk factors in the supply chain on the e-supply chain. The information & policy risk is related  to secure information, copyrights, Intellectual property rights (IPR) and strategic information (Kumar et al., 2019). As for  the environmental risk, the Macroeconomic risks are the external environment, usually referred to as “PESTEL”, adding to  it the natural disasters that may occur, such as extreme weather conditions (tornados, earthquakes, etc.). Regarding the  relations risks, risks like lack of transparency, the ability to commit to these relationships and maintaining supplier  relationships strong and solid (Alshurideh, 2022). Infrastructure risk involves all technological and economical risks,  channels used for goods transportation, and whether the country's infrastructure is dependable enough for the success of the  supply and e-supply chain (Pettit et al., 2019; M. Alshurideh et al., 2022; Kurdi et al., 2022). This leads to demand risks  involving major changes in trends and buying patterns, fluctuations in demand and inaccurate forecasts in demand (Lee et  al., 2022a,b; Yang et al., 2021). Sudden moves from competitors and unexpected cancellations in orders and short product  lifecycles. Finally, this brings us to the organizational risks involving cultural risks, untrained staff, leadership issues, the  organization’s reputation, inbound and outbound logistics/operations and availability. The risk categories can be listed  differently, starting with a variation. Based on previous literature, supply chain risks can affect the e-supply chain, which  may put significance to the hypothesized model of this research. H3: Supply chain risks have a significant impact on the e-supply chain.    3.4 The relationship and impact of information security on supply chain risk with mediating effect of e-supply chain    New supply chain strategies are necessary to better prepare for market volatility and environmental disturbances' growing  quantity and diversity. This is why delivery and shipping companies are more aware of the importance of having information  security to protect their e-supply chain from various risks. As a result, supply chains must be adaptive to keep pace with the  rapid pace of change. Securing the information during its flow in the e-supply chain is necessary and ensures having the right  and updated information (Baabdullah et al., 2019). This is important because we may have some risks in the supply chain  due to internal or external factors, as mentioned earlier. If not controlled, it would be challenging to sustain in the competitive  environment and impact the final quick delivery in the e-supply chain, especially for unexpected disruptions. Electronic Data  Integration is one way of securing the sharing of huge amounts of information with minimum risk and ambiguity (Tarafdar   & Qrunfleh, 2017). Business risk has changed due to the more widespread use of information technology and the reliance on  it for safe and continuous operations (Falasca et al., 2008; Stoneburner et al., 2002). To reduce supply chain risk, the new esupply chain places a strong emphasis on information exchange and building connections with partners in a secure way. The  strategic value of information technology (IT) reduces as it appears more in individual firms and supply networks. Thus,  securing these systems while not incurring exorbitant expenditures is now the most challenging task. There is no question  that the supply chain is adversely affected by information security hazards. This risk requires more investigation. Based on  our findings, to enhance decision-making and SCM, we need to know more about the link between information security in  the e-supply chain and its risk, especially for delivery and shipping companies (Chu et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2019; Purwanto Environment al Risk Information  & Policy                    Risks Relations  Risk Supply  operations  Risk Infrastructur e Risks Organization al Risk  Demand Risk M. T. Alshurideh et al.   /Uncertain Supply Chain Management 11 (2023)   149 et al., 2022). Despite the importance of supply chain security, there are few defined terms in the literature. In order to keep  supply chain assets (such as commodities, buildings, equipment, or data) safe from theft, damage, or unauthorized access,  policies, procedures, and technology are in place (weapons of mass destruction). This applies to the e-supply chain because  there is more emphasis on the concept of information security and supply chain risk.     H4: Information security significantly impacts the E-supply Chain with the mediating effect of Supply chain risk.    3.5 Problem Statement & Research Gap    Although the benefits of Information security in the E-supply chain have been highlighted and agreed upon by several authors  (Aloqool et al., 2022; Chu et al., 2020), some factors are rarely considered, such as the supply chain risk or its mediating role  in information system and e-supply chain in distribution industry UAE. The current research thereby aims to fill the gap in  the corpus of information in this area. Information security is determined to play a significant part in achieving secured  supply chain management, which would enable organizations to improve their organizational performance, more  investigation has to be done before making a final judgment on the risk's repercussions, which is a critical part of the decisionmaking process between information security and the e-supply chain. Supply chain management must study this area to  ensure that the risk of information technology security is adequately addressed when businesses use technology to foster  collaborative partnerships.    3.6 General Research Model  Fig. 1. Research Model 3.7 Research Hypothesis    HO1: Information Security has no statistical impact on Supply Chain Risk in the UAE Distribution Industry.   HO2: Information Security has no statistical impact on the e-Supply Chain in the UAE Distribution Industry.  HO3: Supply Chain Risk has no statistical impact on the e-Supply Chain in the UAE Distribution Industry.  HO4: Information Security has no statistical impact on the e-Supply Chain with the mediating effect of Supply Chain Risk at  the UAE Distribution Industry.    3.8 Research Methodology and Design     To measure the relationship of research variables (Information Security, E-Supply Chain, and SC Risk), the required research  design incorporated the distribution companies based in Dubai & Abu Dhabi, UAE. A convenient sampling technique was  used to access the distribution center’s managerial departments. A quantitative technique with the descriptive, exploratory,  analytical, and causal design was applied. An online survey questionnaire was developed to gather the data via email medium.  The questionnaire data was assessed with regression and hypothesis testing using ANOVA and SPSS.    3.9 Population, Sample & Unit of Analysis    The population for the proposed research targeted 179 Logistics & distribution companies located in Dubai & Abu Dhabi,  UAE. A total of 600 questionnaires were sent via email, and a sample of 301 was received with valid results after screening.  The correspondents of the survey were (Production manager, SC Manager, IT Manager & Product Distributor). To assess the  variables, a 30-item questionnaire has been developed on a 5-point Likert scale (from 1, strongly disagree to 5, strongly  agree). 11 items were used to assess the “Information Security” 9 items were used to assess “E-supply chain” and 10-items  used to assess for “SC Risk”.

Data analysis     4.1 Demographic Analysis    Based on the demographic data, male participants were 217 (72.1%) and female participants 84 (27.9%). This indicates that  males have the largest number of IT managers from various distribution companies. Gender  Job Status  Fig. 2. Personal characteristics of the participants    4.2 Reliability, Descriptive & Correlation    The assessment of research variables was tested for validity and reliability before going for further analysis. The results of  Cronbach’s Alpha show the good reliability of each construct EI=.77, CP=.85, and OBB=.77, respectively. Moreover, the  descriptive stats show that the mean value for Information security (M=3.45, SD=.77), the mean value for Supply Chain Risk  with the lowest ranking (M=3.11, SD=.57). In contrast, E-Supply Chain indicates the highest ranking with the mean value  (M=3.51, SD=.58). Table 1 also represents the correlation coefficient data summary that depicts a significant positive  relationship of Information Security with Supply Chain Risk r=.826. P<0.05, Information Security has a significantly high  correlation with E-supply chain as r=.752, and Supply chain risk is highly correlated with E-supply chain with r=.85, P<0.05.

Discussion of the results     This research demonstrates the significance of supply chain risks to achieving a successful e-supply chain. Table 2 illustrates  that H1 has a significant relationship between information security and supply chain risk at (β=.752, t=19.74) and the variance  as R²=56%. The H1 is supported. On the other hand, the findings reveal a significant impact of supply chain risk on the Esupply chain with (β=.826, t=8.49) and predict a high variance between the information security and e-supply chain R²=68%,  supporting H2. The impact of supply chain risk has a significant impact on the e-supply chain, demonstrated by the data  analysis and also evidenced in the literature (β=.858, t=14.24) and the variance shown in the variables.

The H3 is also supported in this research. Further analysis depicts that the mediating effect has a significant relationship  between information security and the e-supply chain. The data findings show (β=.901, t=10.92) a significant positive impact  of supply chain risk as a mediator, and the variance among variables is R=81%. A high variance range is predicted as a high  dependency on supply chain risk. The present framework provides gap-filling results that demonstrate that IT development  and information security implementation in the supply chain process can prevent supply chain risks and adverse effects to  the organization (Aloqool et al., 2022; Cheung et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2019). The trend of the e-supply chain requires   security attempts for positive benefits to the consumer and healthy organizational performance.   6. Conclusion   The overall research analysis finds an effective E-supply chain and information security due to the early recognition of SC  risks on supply. Risks should be considered as part of the overall supply chain management plan. The conventional sources  of supply chain risk are diminished. However, with information technology solutions that enable information security, the  targeted logistics and distribution industry are increasingly exposed to information technology risk due to cooperation  throughout the supply chain. The supply chain might be less able to meet consumer demand in the future due to information  technology-specific attacks that could take advantage of any flaws in the system. To prevent such losses, early supply chain   screening is recommended, including:  ● Leveraging the “PPRR” (Prevention, Preparedness, Response & Recovery) risk management model  ● Environmental Risk management  ● Improving Cyber SC risk management  ● Tracking the right freight carrier metric  ● Implementing logistics contingency plan  ● Internal risk awareness training sessions  ● Consolidating data with easy access (ecosystem Software) Even though a prevailing review of this research considers cooperation and integration beneficial to supply chain  management, the benefit of IT integration must be weighed against the risks posed by information security flaws. 7. Recommendation and limitations      There are some limitations in the research. First, the targeted industry assessed is limited to the specific area. Thus, future  research should incorporate extensive geographical location. Second, the mediating effect of supply chain risk was examined.  Therefore, future studies are recommended to investigate the brief risk prevention techniques' effects on the supply chain.  However, further study into other areas can be carried out utilizing the risk categories and summary results provided in this  research. To manage supply chain risks more effectively, researchers are expected to gain from this literature review for  future studies.  References Attaran, M. (2007).
