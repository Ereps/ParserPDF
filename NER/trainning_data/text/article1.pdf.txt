Various bandwidth selection methods for KDE least squares cross-validation LSCV and Kullback-Leibler cross-validation are proposed. We propose a method to select the optimal bandwidth for the KDE. The idea behind this method is to generalize the LSCV method, using the measure of β-divergence, and to see the importance of improving our method, we will compares these Dβ(bfh, f) bandwidth selector with a normal reference(NR), the last squares cross-validation(LSCV), the Sheather and Jones (S J) method, and the generalized LSCV(LSCVg) bandwidth selector, on simulated data. The use of the various practical bandwidth selectors is illustrated on a real data example.

Introduction 1 The problem of choosing the bandwidth (window width or smoothing parameter) h is importantly in statistical es2 timation of the kernel density estimation. A vast amount of literatures has been devoted in choosing practical optimal 3 bandwidth for techniques built on kernel estimation et some comparative studies have been made to these methods. 4 Representative surveys of bandwidth selection techniques can be found in Bowman[3], Jones et al.[9], Loader[12], 5 Peter Hall [5] Scott[18],and Wand and Jones[24]. 6 Least-squares cross-validation (LSCV) is Among the earliest bandwidth selectors, this method was suggested by 7 Rudemo [17] and Bowman [2], in the 80s ,it has been the method of reference, but in the early 90s, studies have 8 shown that other methods performs better from the bias points of view and much better in reducing the variance. See 9 Park and Turlach [15] for a detailed description. 10 Interesting comparative studies have been published. Bowman[2] compared two methods for selecting bandwidth, 11 The ﬁrst is the Kullback-Leibler Cross-Validation and the second is that of Integrated Squared Error Cross-Validation. 12 Scott and Terrell [19] compared the two methods by theoretical calculation of the noise in the cross-validation func13 tion and corresponding cross-validated smoothing parameters, by Monte Carlo simulation, and by example. 14 Sheather and Jones [20] set up a plug-in type of three-step procedure. They choose to estimate R( f ′′) (the term un15 known in AMIS E). 16 Jin Zhang [26]) have proposed a generalization the classical least squares cross-validation (LSCV) selector for its 17 variability and under smoothing, He did a comparison of bandwidths for ﬁnite sample behavior. 18 For a more complete treatment, from a historical viewpoint, with complete references, and detailed discussion of 19 variations that have been suggested, see Jones et al. [10] Quick access to implementation of most of the methods 20 discussed here has been provided by park and Jones et al. [9] . 21 22 ∗Corresponding author Email address: papa.ngom@ucad.edu.sn (Papa Ngom) Preprint submitted to Journal Name April 1, 2016 The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the optimal bandwidth hβ for minimizing criterion Dβ(bfn, f) error. 23 We will see that Dβ(bfn, f) generalize the Integrated Square Error (IS E) and Kullback-Leiber divergence (KL). 24 After having introduced the Dβ(bfn, f) selection method we study the ﬁnite sample performances of various bandwidth 25 selectors via a simulation study. We compare ﬁve procedures: the normal reference (NR) method, the last squares 26 cross-validation (LSCV), the Sheather and Jones (S J) method, the generalized LSCV(LSCVg) and criterion Dβ(bfn, f) 27 error. 28 This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the classical methods for bandwidth selections. Section 3 29 presents the new method proposed for bandwidth selector, which generalizes and provides improved for the least 30 squares cross-validation (LSCV). In Section 4 we present some simulation results for estimation and comparison of 31 the various methods. Section 5 applies the methods to real data. Finally, the conclusion and perspective is presented 32 in Section 6. 33 2. Classical Methods for Bandwidth Selection 34 Given an n-sample X1, X2, ..., Xn of independent random variables and same unknown density f. Consider the 35 Parzen-Rosenblatt kernel estimator of the density f given by: 36 bfh(x) = 1 nh n X i=1 K  x − Xi h  (1) h > 0 where is the bandwidth and K. a density function deﬁned on R called kernel. 37 To estimate f, choose the kernel K and h parameter. If the choice of the kernel is not a problem, it is not the case for 38 the choice of the width of the window h which essentially depends on the size n of the sample. There are two methods 39 of families: the family of cross-validation methods and the family of plug-in methods. 40 The decision of an optimal choice for the bandwidth suppose the speciﬁcation of an error criterion that can be opti41 mized. The criterion is to minimize the Mean Integrated Square Error (MIS E). In this case, [E. Parzen [16].] there is 42 obtained 43 MIS E(bfh(x)) = Z E hbfh(x) − f(x) i2 dx = h4 4 µ2(K)2 Z  f ′′(x) 2 dx + R(K) nh + O   h5 + 1 n ! (2) where µ2(K) = R x2K(x)dx is the variance of kernel K and R(g) = R g2(x)dx for any function g. 44 The Asymptotics Mean Integrated Square Error (AMISE) is then of the form: 45 AMIS E(bfh) = h4 4 µ2(K)2R( f ′′) + R(K) nh (3) To ﬁnd the closed form expression for hAMIS E, begin by diﬀerentiating (3) to obtain ∂AMIS E ∂h = −(nh2)−1R(K) + h3µ2(K)2R( f ′′) Setting this equation equal to 0 and solving for h produces 46 hAMIS E = " R(K) nµ2(K)2R( f ′′) #1/5 (4) It is found that the optimal width of hAMIS E window depends on the unknown density f through the parameter 47 R( f ′′), which has to be estimated before using hAMIS E. 48 49 2 A very natural way to get around the problem of not knowing f ′′ is to use a standard family of distributions to 50 assign a value of the term R( f ′′) in expression (4). For example, assume that a density f belongs to the Gaussian family 51 with mean µ and variance σ, then 52 R( f ′′) = Z  f ′′(x) 2 dx = σ−5 R  φ ′′(x) 2 dx = 3 8π−12σ−5 ≈ 0.212σ−5 (5) where φ(x) is the standard normal density. If one uses a Gaussian kernel, then 53 hNR = (4π)−1/10  3 8π−1/2−1/5 σn−1/5 =  4 3 1/5 σn−1/5 (6) If we want to make this estimate more insensitive to outliers, we have to use a more robust estimate for the scale 54 parameter of the distribution. Let bR be the sample interquartile, then one possible choice for h is 55 hNR = 1.06min  bσ, bR (Φ(3/4)−Φ(1/4))  n−1/5 = 1.06min  bσ, bR 1.349  n−1/5 (7) where Φ is the standard normal distribution function. To see more detail (e.g., Silverman, [21]; H¨ardle[8]; Scott, 56 1992). 57 The LSCV, sometimes called an unbiased cross-validation was proposed by Rudemo [17] and Bowman [2]. The 58 criterion is to choose the bandwidth that minimizes an estimator of Integrated Square Error (IS E): 59 IS E = Z bf 2 h (x)dx − 2 Z bfh(x) f(x)dx + Z f 2(x)dx (8) The ideal choice of bandwidth is the one which minimizes: 60 L(h) = IS E − Z f 2(x)dx = Z bf 2 h (x)dx − 2 Z bfh(x) f(x)dx (9) The principle of the least squares cross-validation method is to ﬁnd an estimate of L(h) from the data and minimize 61 it over h. Consider the estimator 62 LSCV(h) = Z bf 2 h (x)dx − 2 n n X i=1 bfh(i)(Xi) (10) with Z bf 2 h (x)dx = 1 n2h n X i=1 n X j=1 (k ∗ k)  Xi − Xj h ! and 63 bfh(i)(Xi) = 1 h(n − 1) n X j,i K  Xi − Xj h ! (11) where ∗ represents the convolution. 64 Further discussion on this method can be found in Bowman [3], and Hall and Marron [7]. Under mild conditions, Hall 65 [5] and Stone [22] proved that hLSCV is asymptotically the best in the sense of minimizing MIS E(bfh). 66 67 3 Sheather and Jones (1991) introduced a reliable bandwidth selector bhS J, which is a plug-in estimator of hAMIS E, 68 the idea of Sheather and Jones is to estimate the quantity R( f ′′) by an estimator of E  f (4)(X)  , by remarking that 69 R( f ′′) = E  f (4)(X)  = R f (4)(x) f(x)dx. 70 71 Jin Zhang [26] introduced a generalization of classical least squares cross-validation(LSCV), his method provides 72 a signiﬁcant improvement for (LSCV). 73 Used it as the case that K is the Gaussian kernel φ. According to Equation 10, 74 LSCV(h) = φ √ 2h(0) n − 2 n(n − 1) X i<j " 2φh(Xi − Xj) +  1 n − 1 ! φ √ 2h(Xi − Xj) # (12) Jin Zhang [26] is generalized LSCV by: 75 LSCVg(h) = φ √ 2h(0) n + 2 n(n − 1) X i< j " 2 g(g − 2)φ √gh(Xi − Xj) +  1 n − 1 g − 2 ! φ √ 2h(Xi − X j) # (13) g with a positive number. 76 The generalized LSCV bandwidth selector hLSCVg is deﬁned as the minimize of LSCVg(h) over h 77 3. β-Divergence for Bandwidth Selection 78 The basic Beta-divergence was introduced by Basu et al. [1] and Minami and Eguchi [14]. 79 The β-Divergence measure for bandwidth selection will be introduced in this section to improve the behavior of 80 the choice for bandwidth. 81 Dβ(bfh, f(x)) = 1 β Z S bf β h (x)dx − 1 β − 1 Z S bf β−1 h (x) f(x)dx + 1 β(β − 1) Z S f β(x)dx in the case β = 2, 82 2D2(bfh, f(x)) = IS E(bfh) = Z S (bfh(x) − f(x))2dx So we can say that IS E is a special case of Dβ. Note, the optimal bandwidth that minimizes Dβ(bfn,h, f(x)) is equivalent to the bandwidth that minimizes the expected value of the quantity: Dβ(h) = Dβ(bfh, f(x)) − 1 β(β − 1) Z S f β(x)dx = 1 β Z S bf β h (x)dx − 1 β − 1 Z S bf β−1 h (x) f(x)dx The principle of the least squares cross-validation method is to ﬁnd an estimate of Dβ(h) from the data and minimize 83 it over h. Consider the estimator, 84 DβCV(h) = 1 β Z S bf β h (x)dx − 1 n(β − 1) n X i=1 bf β−1 h(i) (Xi) (14) with bf β−1 h(i) (Xi) is deﬁned in (11) 85 When we want to implement this technique on the computer, the computation of minimized DβCV(h) for a of band86 widths h may be based on the following algorithm: 87 88 4 Algorithm 1 algorithm for minimize DβCV(h) 1: for i = 1 to n do 2: c1 = 1 nhβ−1 3: c2 = 1 βhnβ−1 4: c3 = 1 (β−1)(n−1)β−1 5: S um = 0 6: S um1 = 0 7: for j = 1 to n do 8: S um1 = S um1 + K  Xi−Xj h  9: S um = c2 ∗ (S um1)β − c3 ∗ (S um1 − K (0))β−1 10: end forDβCV(h) = c1 ∗ S um 11: end for hDβCV = arg min h  DβCV(h)  Theorem 1.

Simulation 108 We approximate the true density f by a normal mixture. 109 f(x) = J X j=1 ωjφσ j(x − µj) (23) where J is a positive integer. ω1, ..., ωJ is a set of positive numbers that sum to one, and for each j, −∞ < µj < ∞ and 110 σ j > 0. The family of normal mixture densities used by (Marron and Wand [13]) is extremely rich, and, in fact, any 111 density can be approximated arbitrarily well by a member of this family. 112 for f given by Equation 23, the MIS E in Equation (2 ) of the kernel density estimator in Equation (1) have explicit 113 forms. In fact, 114 MIS E(bfh(x)) = (2π1/2nh)−1 + wT{(1 − n−1)Ω2 − 2Ω1 + Ω0}w (24) (Marron and Wand [13]) where w = (ω1, ..., ωJ) and Ωa is the J × J matrix having (j × j) entry equal to φ q ah2+σ2 j+σ2 j′ (µ j − µj′) . 115 We consider the normal mixture in the case of J = 2 and ω1 = ω2 = 0.5, similar similation were performed by Jin 116 Zhang [26]. Therefore the true density is: 117 f(x) = 0.5φ(x) + 0.5φσ(x − µ) (25) Based on 50, 200, 700 draws from f in the case where µ = 0, 1, 5 and σ = 1, 0.5, 0.1. Table 1 give the exhibits 118 the simulated relative eﬃciency RE bh  = MIS E bfbhMIS E  /MIS E bfbh  of the kernel estimator, using bandwidths bhNR, 119 bhLSCV, bhS J, bhLSCV4 and bhDβCV(with β = 1.1, 1.5, 4 and 4), it is lower wherever than 1, because the optimal bandwidth 120 hMIS E minimize MIS E. Each bandwidth, mean E bh  and mean relation error E|bh/hMIS E − 1| are obtained, these 121 values are given by respectively Tables 2 and 3. 122 123 1. It can be seen that when the density f is not very far from normal, such as that cases of (µ, σ) = (0, 1), (0, 0.5), (1, 1) 124 and (1, 0.5), bandwidth which are obtained by using NR criterion performs well. In other cases it usually has 125 the smallest RE(bh) and largest E(bh),tending to over smooth its kernel density estimate the most. 126 2. From these tables it can be seen that bandwidth bhLSCV which are obtained by using LSCV performs poorly if 127 the true density is close to normal usually having the smallest RE(bh) and E(bh), then the kernel density estimator 128 is undersmoothed. But in the contrary case, bhLSCV can perform very well, and in many situations, in Table 2 it 129 is seen that E(bhLSCV) is close to the optimal bhMIS E, but the corresponding E(bhLSCV/bhMIS E − 1) is large, which 130 means that the bias ofbhLSCV is small but its variation is large. 131 3. The plug-in bandwidth bhS J seen to be the best existing bandwidth selectors (as commented by Venables and 132 Ripley [23]). bhS J among the best bandwidth selectors in most situations. However it behaves very poorly for 133 small σ (the density curve is sharp), oversmoothing its kernel density curve by overestimatingbhMIS E. 134 4. As commented by J. Zhang [26], The generalized LSCV bandwidth bhLSCV4 seems to be bandwidth selectors 135 that is always among the best for having large RE(bh) and small E|bh/hMIS E − 1|. 136 5. The proposed bandwidth selector method (bhDβCV) completely dominate the selection methods Bandwidth as n 137 increases, otherwise bhDβCV (with β = 1.1, 1.5, 1.8 and 4) are with bhLSCV4 bandwidths selectors that are always 138 among the best. for having large RE(bhDβCV) and small E|bhDβCV/hMIS E − 1| for most cases. They signiﬁcantly 139 improve the classicalbhLSCV. Indeed Figue1 shows that the increase in n causes a value of RE(bhDβCV) close to 1 140 7 and greater than RE(bhLSCV) 141 Figure 2 show that for the DβCV, this bias does not have a serious eﬀect on the eﬃciency of the method, since 142 the RE(bhDβCV) is relatively close to 1. We can conclude from Figure 2 our practical selection procedures DβCV 143 have a performance close to the one for the LSCV4 bandwidth selector (since the ratios are relatively close to 144 1). 145 8 Figure 1: RE(bh) using bandwidthsbhLSCV,bhLSCV4 andbhDβCV with β = 1.1, 1.5, 1.8, 4 9 Figure 2: Kernel density estimates with diﬀerent bandwidths.

Examples 146 In this Section, we will provided two examples to evaluate performance of our method compared to several clas147 sical bandwidth selection methods for Gaussian kernel density. The two data sets in the examples have been analyzed 148 by many authors ( Silverman [21] and J. Zhang [26]) to illustrate various kinds of methods in density estimation. 149 150 The ﬁrst example comprises the lengths of 86 spells of psychiatric treatment undergone by control patients used 151 as controls in a study of suicide risks reported by Copas and Fryer [4]; Silverman [21]. 152 Figure 2a plot the data points and the kernel density estimates for the suicide study data, when we using commonly 153 used bandwidthsbhNR = 35.78,bhS J = 23.16,bhLSCV = 15.69,bhLSCV4 = 22.57 and hD1.1CV = 24.25. 154 It seems that the density for the length of treatment is a unimodal curve heavily skewed to the right. it seems clear 155 than the bandwidth hNR oversmooth her kernel density curve and underestimate the peak near 20. 156 The bandwidths were obtained by using the methods of S J, LSCV4 and D1.1CV, are better because bhS J, bhLSCV4 and 157 bhD1.1CV well balance the two situations and seem to capture the true shape of the data. In this example,bhLSCV4 = 27.57 158 andbhD1.1CV = 24.25 are closer tobhS J = 23.16. 159 160 The second comprises the lengths in minutes of 107 eruption lengths in minutes for the Old Faithful geyser in 161 Yellowstone National Park, USA (source: Weisberg [25]; Silverman [21]). 162 Figure 2b plot the data points and the kernel density estimates for Old Faithful geyser data, we using bandwidths 163 bhNR = 0.4331,bhS J = 0.2250,bhLSCV = 0.1030,bhLSCV4 = 0.1740 andbhD1.1CV = 0.1480. 164 An important point to note that the density curve for eruption length is similar to bimodal normal density (normal 165 mixture). As commented by Zing, the bandwidthS bhNR is heavily over smoothes its kernel density curve, underesti166 mating the two peaks of the curve but overestimating the valley between them. On the other hand, bhLSCV seems to 167 undersmooth the curve too much, overestimating the two peaks but underestimating for the valley. 168 However bhS J, bhLSCV4 and bhD1.1CV, especially the later, are proper bandwidths for their density estimates to be able to 169 capture the feature of the true density curve. 170 10 7. Conclusions 171 The kernel estimator is the most used in density estimation. The main issue is bandwidth selection, which is a hot 172 topic and is still frustrating statisticians. A various bandwidth selection strategies have been proposed such as normal 173 reference bhNR , unbiased cross-validation bhLSCV, cross validation, Sheather-Jones method bhS J and and most recently 174 Zing proposed a bandwidthbhLSCVg. 175 The normal reference bandwidth bhNR method is limited the practical use, since they are restricted to situations where 176 a pre-speciﬁed family of densities is correctly selected. The popularity of the LSCV method is due to the intuitive 177 motivation and the fact that bhLSCV is asymptotically optimal under low conditions. Bandwidth bhS J seems to be the 178 best existing bandwidth selector. Unfortunately, it also tends to oversmooth the density estimate when the true density 179 curve is sharp. 180 We have attempted to evaluate choice the optimal bandwidth bhLSCV, using β-divergence. Compared to traditional 181 bandwidth selection methods designed for kernel density estimation, our proposed DβCV bandwidth selection method 182 is always one of the best for having large RE bh  and small E|bh/hMIS E−1|. Simulation studies showed that our proposed 183 novel optimal bandwidth method designed for kernel density estimation signiﬁcantly improves the classicalbhLSCV for 184 its variability and undersmoothing, adapts to diﬀerent situations, and outperforms other bandwidths. 185 References 186 [1] Basu, A.; Harris, I.R.; Hjort, N.; Jones, M.
