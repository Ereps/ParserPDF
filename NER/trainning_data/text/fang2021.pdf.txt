Introduction Interfaces, the connection between two different components in  composite members, exist widely in all types of composite  structures (CS), including the steel–concrete composite structure  (SCCS), the timber–concrete composite structure (TCCS) (Cosenza  and Pecce, 2001), the assembled concrete composite structure  (ACCS) (Xue et al., 2019), and the repaired/reinforced concrete  composite structure (RCCS) (Halicka, 2011). Old and new concrete interfaces are widely present in concrete structures, not only in  RCCSs (Long et al., 2014) but also in new ACCSs (Xue et al.,  2020). The shrinkage and creep of different materials, or rather  different types of concrete, cause various engineering problems  such as slips and cracks (Cyron et al., 2019; Orta and Bartlett, 2020). An assembled concrete composite structure is a building  structure the concrete components of which, namely beams,  columns, wall panels, and floor units, are cast either at a factory  or at a fixed location on site, and the completed elements are  erected and assembled in situ (Chiang et al., 2006; Hong et al.,  2018; Kurama et al., 2018). This form of structure has the advantages  of the high construction efficiency, the high quality of precast  units, and the reduction of in situ formwork (Fan et al., 2020; Hu  et al., 2020). Thus, ACCSs have been rapidly promoted and widely applied in the world (Khoo et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2012). However,  there are a large number of concrete bonding interfaces in ACCSs,  which are the weak parts influencing the structural performance  such as flexural resistance (Gohnert, 2000; Gillum et al., 2001), ARTICLE HISTORY ABSTRACT Received 24 November 2020 Revised 1 March 2021 Accepted 14 April 2021 Published Online 18 June 2021 KEYWORDS There are a large number of concrete bonding interfaces in assembled concrete structures.  Moreover, the problems of deformation and coordination at the interfaces lead to weak  bonding under shrinkage and creep. The theoretical methods and analytical solutions for the  long-term performance of composite structures in recent literatures are relatively complicated  for the review or optimization in the design stage. Hence, a method for calculating the midspan deflection of and the cross-sectional stress on composite beams under shrinkage and  creep was developed based on the average curvature method. The calculation method was  then verified by the experiments and the numerical simulations. Further, factors affecting the  deflection of and the stress on the assembled concrete composite beams, including the  loading age, the reinforcement ratio, the section dimensions, and the surface area in contact  with the atmosphere were analyzed by using the developed method. The results revealed that  the adjustment of the section dimensions and the loading time is the effective optimization  approach. A framework for review or optimization of composite concrete beams based on the  sensitivity analysis is proposed and a case study is carried out. The results of this work can  helpfully be used to control the risk of additional deflections or cracking during the long-term  operation of buildings. Assembled composite beams Shrinkage Creep Calculation method Numerical simulation Sensitivity analysis Design optimization CORRESPONDENCE Jianghong Mao   jhmao@nit.zju.edu.cn   Institute of Structural and Bridge Engineering, Ningbo Tech University, Ningbo 315000, China; Ningbo                   Research Institute, Zhejiang University, Ningbo 315000, China; College of Architecture & Environment, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China ⓒ 2021 Korean Society of Civil Engineers KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering 3459 shear resistance (Halicka, 2011), and durability (Huang et al.,  2019b). Moreover, the additional deflections or unexpected cracking of these structures due to the different shrinkage and creep behaviors of old and new concrete are special engineering problems, the  effect mechanism and the controlling method of which should  receive further attention. The effect mechanism of the additional deflections or unexpected  cracking of CS has been reported in some literature (Beushausen,  2016; Lam et al., 2019). In fact, materials used in CSs have their  respective shrinkage characteristics, which causes differential  movement at the interface; this mechanism is considered as an  important reason for the above problems (Lam et al., 2019). It  has been reported that the flexural deformation of and the tensile  stress on concrete due to the restrained shrinkage (Khan et al.,  2017; Zhu et al., 2020) can result in cracking if the tensile strength of  the concrete is exceeded. Although the effect mechanisms of  various types of composite structures are similar, there are a  number of obvious differences between ACCSs and the other  CSs, leading to some new issues. Firstly, the shrinkage and creep behaviors of the materials on  both sides of the interface of ACCSs differ from those of other  composite structures. For example, the steel in SCCSs or the  timber in TCCSs hardly shrinks and creeps. Moreover, the  loading age of the old concrete of RCCSs is extremely large, and  shrinkage has already progressed in the concrete matrix (Jung et  al., 2017), which implies that the shrinkage and creep of old  concrete are almost developed in RCCSs. Nonetheless, the  loading age of the old concrete of ACCSs is much smaller, so the  shrinkage and creep of the new and old concrete need to be  considered simultaneously. The loading age of concrete is an  important factor influencing the behavior of creep and is considered  in creep prediction codes (ACI Committee 209, 1982; CEB, 1992) or  empirical models (Bažant and Bweja, 1995; Gardner and Lockman,  2001). Therefore, the additional deflection of and the stress on  composite structures can be apparently different (Huang et al.,  2019a). Secondly, compared with SCCSs and TCCSs, ACCSs own a  simple section form and material properties (Xue et al., 2019).  Thus, theoretical formulations and numerical solutions can be  proposed for calculating the deflection of and the stress on  ACCSs under shrinkage and creep. The finite element method  (FEM) is commonly used for analyzing the long-term performance of composite structures (Erkmen and Bradford, 2011; Si and Au,  2011; Liu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2016). Although the deflection  of and the stress on composite structures under shrinkage and  creep can be obtained by the FEM (Ban et al., 2015; Han et al.,  2019; Morenoa et al., 2019; Martinelli, 2021), it is relatively  complicated for practical structure design or optimization. Therefore,  it is necessary to propose a theoretical calculation method for  design and optimization. Some analytical models of the mechanical  performance of composite beams have been reported in the  related literature (Schnabl et al., 2007; Ecsedi and Baksa, 2016;  Cas et al., 2018; Magnucki et al., 2020). Further, a number of  improved models considering the long-term effect of the interface of SCCSs have been proposed (Ranzi and Bradford, 2006; Chen  and Yossef, 2016; Bertagnoli et al., 2017); the interface effect is  only taken into account for the concrete part of SCCSs. However,  since both concrete parts of ACCSs are under the sustained and  time-dependent interface effect, it is necessary to develop a  special theoretical model of ACCSs. The design process of the components of ACCSs differs from  that of normal reinforced concrete because the shrinkage and  creep give rise to the risk of the additional deflection and  unexpected cracking of ACCSs. In addition to section design  based on the ultimate limit state, the section review or optimization  considering shrinkage and creep should be added during checking the traditional serviceability limit state. There are a number of  factors which are beneficial to the reduction the additional  deflection of and the stress on the interface of ACCSs. The  factors with the function of changing the shrinkage and creep  behavior can be considered as the optimizable parameters. They  include the loading age, the reinforcement ratio, the section  dimensions, and the surface area in contact with the atmosphere.  Thus, the additional deflection or unexpected cracking can be  controlled during the design stage of ACCSs. Based on the average curvature method (Chen, 1981), this paper develops a theoretical formula for calculating the additional mid-span deflection of and the section stress on assembled  concrete composite beams. The differential shrinkage and creep  results in additional deflections and stresses, and its timedependent creep effect is considered in the calculation. The accuracy of the theoretical model is then verified by the experimentation  and the numerical simulation. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis  using the developed theoretical model is conducted to examine  the effect mechanisms of the different parameters, and the  influence of each parameter on the mid-span deflection, the  section stress, and possible failure time is studied. Finally, a  design optimization frame is proposed to control the additional  deflection of and the stress on the interface of ACCBs. The  results of this work can provide a scientific basis and a guidance  for the design of assembled concrete composite beams considering  shrinkage and creep. 2. Theoretical Calculation Method 2.1 Deflection Calculation Method 2.1.1 Fundamental Hypotheses The separated precast beams and slabs are combined with castin-place concrete in an assembled structure. A T-section is then  formed by the precast members and the cast-in-place members.  According to the calculation width of the flange in a T-section  beam given by Code GB 50010 (2010), an assembled concrete  composite beam (ACCB) with a typical cross-section is proposed.  The typical section of the ACCB is shown in Fig. 1(a). The  CEB–FIP models and the ACI models are widely used to calculate  the shrinkage and creep in practical applications respectively; in  this paper, the CEB–FIP 90 model (CEB, 1992) is adopted in the 3460 Y. Fang et al. theoretical calculation. The following hypotheses are introduced  while calculating the deflection of the ACCB: 1. The ACCB is in the elastic working stage; 2. Steel bars in the ACCB are converted into the equivalent  concrete. The gravity axis of the section and the force on it  remain unchanged during the conversion; 3. The stiffness of the flange of the section is far lower than  that of the web. The impact of the shrinkage and creep of  the precast concrete on the deflection of the ACCB can be  ignored. Therefore, the precast concrete (PRC) at the flange is  replaced with the cast-in-place concrete (CIC). The replaced  section is shown in Fig. 1(b). 2.1.2 Deflection Composition The deflection of the ACCB (w) increases with time under  shrinkage and creep, and it can be expressed by , (1) where w0 is the initial deflection of the ACCB caused by the  load, w1 represents the variation in the deflection of the ACCB  under creep, and w2 indicates the deflection variation of the  ACCB caused by the differential shrinkage and creep (DSC) at  the interface between the PRC and CIC. 2.1.3 Variation in Deflection of the ACCB under Creep The development of the deflection of the ACCB is shown in Fig. 2.  An initial deflection of the ACCB (w0) is produced by a load, and  it increases under the creep. Before compositing the PRC and the  CIC, the deflections of the PRC and the CIC are ϕpw0 and ϕcw0,  respectively. When the PRC and the CIC are composited, the  final deflection of the ACCB after deformation coordination is  w1. The deformation of the PRC and the CIC is inversely  proportional to the bending stiffness. Therefore, the deflection of  the PRC after being composited (wp) is expressed in , (2) where ϕp and ϕc are the creep coefficient of the PRC and the  CIC, respectively. E1I1 and E2I2 represent the bending stiffness of  the CIC and the PRC after equivalent substitution, respectively. The deflection of an ACCB (w1) while considering creep is  expressed through . (3) 2.1.4 Deflection of the ACCB Caused by Differential Shrinkage and Creep The difference in the strains of the PRC and the CIC is defined as  the differential shrinkage and creep (DSC), which is denoted by  D, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The DSC is caused by the differential  movement between concrete with different strength grade and  the loading age. According to the deformation coordination, the  deformation of PRC and the CIC at the composite interface  should be identical. Thus, a bending deflection of the ACCB  occurs as shown in Fig. 3(b), where θ is the mid-span curvature,  and shear stress exists at the composite interface between the  PRC and the CIC. The average curvature method proposed by  Chen (1981) supposes that the curvature caused by the DSC is  uniformly distributed along the beam when calculating the  additional deflection of the ACCB caused by the DSC, and the w w0 w1 w2 + + = ( ) 1 1 0 1 1 2 2 p c p E I w w E I E I ϕ ϕ = − + 2 2 1 1 1 0 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 p c E I E I w w E I E I E I E I ϕ ϕ ⎛ ⎞ = + ⎜ ⎟ + + ⎝ ⎠ Fig. 1.

According to the relationship between the deflection  of the beam and the mid-span curvature, the deflection caused by  D and θ at the mid-span of the ACCB is given by , (4) where α is related to the load form, which is 23/216 under a fourpoint loading; L is the span; θc and θs indicate the mid-span  curvatures caused by the DSC and are calculated by , (5) , (6) where H is the distance between the neutral axis of the differential stresses on the PRC and the CIC and can be calculated by the  average curvature method; Dc and Ds are the mid-span differential creep and differential shrinkage respectively and are defined as , (7) , (8) where ε0 is the initial strain at the composite interface; and   represent the creep coefficient of the CIC and the PRC, respectively;   and   indicate the shrinkage strain of the CIC at the loading moment and at the calculation  moment, respectively;   and   stand for the shrinkage strain of the PRC at the loading moment and at the calculation  moment, respectively. 2.1.5 Effect of Creep on Deflection Caused by DSC Although both the PRC and the CIC undergo long-term creep  after being composited, the effect of the interactions between  these two parts under long-term creep was not considered while  calculating w2. The influence of creep on w2 can be divided into  two parts: the first one is a reduction in the deflection of the  ACCB because the long-term creep decreases the DSC, and the  second part is an increase in the deflection of the ACCB because  the long-term creep enlarges the curvature. Because of the creep effect of the interaction between the two  parts, the DSC under long-term creep is smaller than the one recorded before compositing the beam and is calculated by . (9) The actual value of the DSC after compositing the beam is  denoted by d. The strains on the bottom of the CIC (μc) and on  the top of the PRC (μp) are defined as , (10) , (11) where a and b are related to the stiffness of the section and can be  calculated as follows: , (12) . (13) During the period of time Δt, the variation in d under creep is  given by . (14) Therefore, d and D have the following relationship . (15) According to Eq. (4), the deflection caused by the actual DSC is expressed by , (16) where the value of k ranges from α to 0.125 and is related to the  proportions of Dc and Ds in D. It is set at 0.125 in this work since  the differential creep is much smaller than the differential shrinkage,  that is,  . The reduction in the deflection of the ACCB considering the  long-term creep (the first part of the effect) can be obtained by  substituting Eq. (14) into Eq. (16) (17) The increment in the deflection of the ACCB (the second part  of the effect) during Δt is given by . (18) Therefore, the variation in w2 considering   and during Δt is defined as (19) ( ) 2 2 0.125 c s w L αθ θ = + / c Dc H θ = / s Ds H θ = ( ) ( ) ( ) 0 c = cc pc D t t ϕ ϕ ε − ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 0 0 s = csh csh psh psh D t t t t ε ε ε ε − − − ϕcc t( ) ϕpc t( ) εcsh t0 ( ) εcsh t( ) εpsh t0 ( ) εpsh t( ) D Dc +Ds = c ad µ = p bd µ = 2 2 1 1 2 2 E I a E I E I = + 1 1 1 1 2 2 E I b E I E I = + p p c c d μ ϕ μ ϕ Δ = Δ + Δ ( ) d d c p d D ad bd ϕ ϕ = − + ∫ ( ) ( ) 2 / wd t kd t L H = c s D D ≪ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 2 2 2 / / p p c c p c p c d w k L H k bd t ad t L H b a w t μ ϕ μ ϕ ϕ ϕ ϕ ϕ Δ − = Δ + Δ = Δ + Δ = Δ + Δ .

(20) The values of d and w2 are calculated with the assistance of  MATLAB software in this work since they can hardly be  calculated directly. 2.2 Calculation Method of Cross-Sectional Stress 2.2.1 Stress Composition The cross-sectional stress on the ACCB can be expressed in , (21) where σ0 is the initial stress caused by loading; σ1 represents the  stress caused by the DSC at the composite interface as shown in  Fig. 3; σρ indicates the stress caused by the restraining effect of  the steel bars on the concrete. 2.2.2 Stress Caused by DSC The stresses on the upper and lower sections of the CIC and the  PRC are given by , (22) , (23) , (24) . (25) The parameters of the average curvature method are shown in Fig. 4. θ is the curvature caused by the DSC and can be calculated by , (26) d is also determined by Eq. (15). 2.2.3 Stress Caused by Steel Bars The steel bars in the concrete restrain the shrinkage and the creep of  the concrete, which produces an interaction force. The influence  region of the steel bars is divided into two parts as shown in Fig. 5(a). In region I, the steel bars are distributed uniformly around the  concrete. Therefore, the strain of the concrete is considered as  the shrinkage and creep strains in the center of the concrete  section. According to the force equilibrium as shown in Fig. 5(b), the relationship between the strain of the steel bars and the strain  of the concrete is defined as , (27) , (28) where εc and εs are the tensile strain of the concrete and the  compressive strain of the steel bars, respectively; Ec and Es represent the elastic moduli of the concrete and the steel bars,  respectively; Ac and As stand for the area of the concrete and the  steel bars, respectively; εcosh and εcoc indicate the shrinkage strain  and the creep strain in the center of the region, respectively. εcosh and εcoc are expressed through , (29) , (30) where   and   are the shrinkage strain of the CIC concrete at the calculation moment and at the loading moment,  respectively;   represents the strain of the center zone of the concrete at the loading moment;   indicates the creep coefficient of the CIC at the calculation moment. In accordance with Eqs. (27) and (28), εc is calculated by , (31) where αES is the ratio between the elastic modulus of steel and  that of concrete. ρp indicates the reinforcement ratio of region I. In region II, the steel bars are at the bottom of the beam.

Similarly, as shown in Fig. 5(c), the tensile strain of the concrete  (εp) in region II can be defined as , (32) where ρp is the reinforcement ratio of region II. The tensile stresses on the upper and lower sides of the CIC  (σρcT and σρcB) and the PRC (σρpT and σρpB) can be calculated  using Eqs. (31) and (32) as follows , (33) . (34) 3. Verification of Theoretical Method The main purposes of the verification of the developed theoretical method were the validation of the deflection calculation method  by a sustained loading experiment and the validation of the stress  calculation method by a numerical simulation. 3.1 Sustained Loading Experiment A sustained loading experiment was carried out according to the section dimensions and the reinforcement of the beam as shown  in Fig. 6(a). The characteristic parameters of the section of the ACCBs  were calculated and listed in Table 1, and the loading ages of the  PRC and the CIC are presented in Table 2. The beams were supported by a hinge bearing and a roller  bearing, and the length of the beam was 2,000 mm. A pure bending  segment with a length of 600 mm was formed under a four-point  loading, and the load at each loading point was 9.8 kN.

Fang et al. proportion and compressive strength of the concrete are given in  Table 3. The reinforcements were ribbed steel bars of Chinese grade  HRB400. To avoid disturbance during the measurements, a steel  frame was placed on the top of the beam. Moreover, a dial gauge  was fixed in the middle of the steel frame to measure the deflection  at the mid-span of the composite beam as shown in Fig. 6(b). The  layout of the sustained loading experiment is depicted in Fig. 6(c). 3.2 Numerical Simulation Method The measurement of the long-term stress on the section is quite  difficult because the variations in the stress on it is slight.  Therefore, a numerical simulation method was proposed for  calculating the deflection of and the stress on the ACCBs under  shrinkage and creep by utilizing ANSYS software (ANSYS Inc.,  2007). In the finite element model, SOLID186 units were used to  simulate the concrete, and LINK8 units were employed to simulate the steel bars since the elastic working stage was studied in this  case due to the first hypothesis. The geometric and physical  parameters of the models were identical to those of the experimental  beams. There was no slip between the CIC, the PRC, and the  steel bars, and the beam had a mapped grid. The creep effect was studied by USERCREEP, a user subroutine  of ANSYS, and the creep coefficient was determined by the  CEB–FIP 90 model (CEB, 1992): , (35) , (36) . (37) The meaning of the parameters is the same as that described  in the model code. The flow chart of the numerical simulation  method is shown in Fig. 7. The equation for updating the creep strain is given by , (38) where εc(t) is the creep strain, and ϕ(t) represents the creep  coefficient. The shrinkage strain was simulated by accounting for the  temperature variation and was equivalent to the thermal strain.  The temperature field of the whole ACCB was considered to be  related to time. The coefficient of linear thermal expansion is  calculated by , (39) where T represents the temperature; εsh(t0) and εsh(t) indicate the  shrinkage strain at the loading moment and at the calculation  moment respectively and are determined by the CEB–FIP 90  model (CEB, 1992): , (40) , (41) . (42) The meaning of the parameters is the same as that described  in the model code. This method can be used to calculate the creep strain after the  stress–strain redistribution caused by the shrinkage and the creep  in each time step. 3.3 Results of Verification 3.3.1 Deflection The loading moment, the concrete strength, and the creep model  were similar in the theoretical method, the experiment, and the  numerical simulation. The theoretical, experimental, and numerical  data on the coefficients of the deflection creep of the composite  beams are plotted in Fig. 8; the coefficients of the deflection  creep in Fig. 8 are defined as . (43) This figure shows that the results are very close. In fact, for  L2 and L3, the difference between the experimental data and the  other results is quite small. For L1, the experimental data are  marginally smaller than the simulation and theoretical results  during most of the holding time but are very close to the other  two at a holding time of approximately 365 d.

The Flow Chart of the Numerical Simulation Method KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering 3465 3.3.2 Stress The mid-span stress on the ACCBs with a CIC loading age of 28  d and a PRC loading age of 68, 98, 128, and 158 d was simulated  by the numerical simulation method. The other parameters of the  ACCBs were identical to those in Section 3.1. The results of the  loading age of 68 d are shown in Fig. 9. According to Fig. 9, the numerical simulation and the theoretical calculation follow an identical trend. The tensile stress on the  bottom of the PRC (σ2B) increases with time, and the compressive  stress on the top of the PRC (σ2T) first enlarges but then decreases with time. The compressive stress on the bottom of the CIC (σ1B)  changes to the tensile stress during the loading and increases  with time, while the compressive stress on the top of the CIC  (σ1T) declines with time. The results of the numerical simulation and the theoretical  calculation at the other loading ages of the PRC are shown in Fig.  10(a). The difference between the stress on the ACCB determined  by the numerical simulation and the one obtained from the theoretical calculation is plotted in Fig. 10(b). This figure demonstrates that the  stress difference varies linearly with the loading age of the PRC,  which is because the effect of the reinforcement constraint on the  concrete reduces the deformation in the numerical simulation.  However, in the theoretical calculation, the reinforcement is  converted into concrete based on the second hypothesis, and the  constraint effect of the reinforcement on the concrete is ignored. The  reinforcement produces a tensile strain on the concrete, and the  shrinkage strain of the CIC is larger than that of the PRC. Therefore,  the tensile strain produced by the reinforcement of the CIC is larger  than the strain of the PRC. The ratio of the stress difference to the  stress produced by the steel bars in the concrete is plotted in Fig.  10(c). This ratio correlates closely with the loading age. The  coefficient of determination (R2) are 0.99, 0.97, and 0.96. Using the  fitting results, Eqs. (33) and (34) are corrected to , (44) , (45) , (46) , (47) where tp0 is the loading age of the PRC. The cross-sectional stress  on the bottom of the beam (σ2B) calculated by the theoretical method  is close to the one determined by the numerical simulation.  Therefore, it is not necessary to correct σ2B. From the verification results, it can be concluded that it is  reasonable and feasible to use the theoretical method for  calculating the deflection of the ACCB.

Sensitivity Analysis of Parameters Using Theoretical Calculation Method This paper presents a practical method for calculating the deflection of and the stress on ACCBs under shrinkage and creep. In  addition, this study verifies the effectiveness of the practical  method through the experiments and the numerical simulations.  There are many design parameters influencing the deflection of  or the stress on ACCBs. The parameters closely related to the  shrinkage and creep behavior of concrete need to be taken into  account. Indeed, because of the development of concrete hydration,  concrete is more susceptible to creep at an early age (Criel et al.,  2015). The reinforcement in concrete can partly bear the initial  stress applied on the concrete, so it restrains the concrete creep  (Chen et al., 2020) and benefits the reduction of the creep  influence. Furthermore, the drying of the interior of structures  depends on the distance from the surface (Maekawa et al., 2011),  so the effect of shrinkage and creep is also controlled by the  section dimensions and its contact area with the atmosphere.  Based on the above analysis, the loading age, the reinforcement  ratio, the section dimensions, and the surface area in contact with  the atmosphere were selected for the parametric sensitivity  analysis of the ACCB. In order to analyze the sensitivity of the parameters, a case  study was carried out. The span of the beam was 3,600 mm, and  it had a rectangular cross-section with a width and height of 200  and 400 mm, respectively. The height of the CIC was 120 mm.  Also, the uniformly distributed load was 5 kN/m. The crosssection and the reinforcement are shown in Fig. 11. The optimized  variables based on the parameters of the ACCBs are listed in  Table 4. The deflection of the ACCB, the stress on the CIC and the  PRC, and the stress comparison at a loading time of 365 d were  selected for the analysis. The performance of the ACCB with the  different loading ages of the PRC, reinforcement ratios, section  dimensions, and surface areas in contact with the atmosphere are  shown in Figs. 12 − 15, and 17. The meaning of σ1T, σ1B, σ2T, and  σ2B is the same as that in Fig. 9. According to GB 50010 (2010),  the standard tensile strength—which is the characteristic tensile  strength with a confidence level of 95%—of Chinese standard  C30 and C35 concrete is 2.01 and 2.20 MPa, respectively. The  concrete strength acts as a criterion for judging the risk of  cracking. 4.1 Loading Age of PRC Figure 12 shows the performance of the ACCB at different  loading ages. Fig. 10. The Difference between the Results of the Theoretical Method  and Those of the Numerical Simulation at the End of a Year: (a) Comparison between the Theoretical Calculation and the  Numerical Simulation, (b) Difference between the Theoretical  Calculation and the Numerical Simulation at a Holding Time  of 365 d, (c) Ratio of the Stress Difference to the Tensile Stress  on the Concrete Caused by the Steel Bars Fig. 11. The Cross-Sectional Parameters of the ACCBs KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering 3467 Figure 12(a) shows the deflection of the ACCB at different loading ages. It is evident that the deflection of the ACCB  increases as the loading age of the PRC rises. The PRC with a  larger loading age has less shrinkage under the sustained loading.  At an identical loading age of the CIC, the ACCB made of the  PRC with a smaller loading age has a smaller DSC (both d and D). Thus, the mid-span deflection of the ACCB declines due to  the reduction of w2. Therefore, a reduction in the loading age of  the PRC is favorable to the control of the deflection of the  ACCB. The mid-span section stress on the bottom of the CIC and the  PRC at the different loading ages is shown in Figs. 12(b) and Table 4. The Parameters of the ACCB with the Optimized Variables Beam name Loading age of PRC /d Width /mm Height /mm Height of CIC /mm Reinforcement ratio /% Load /kN·m−1 EL1 58 200 400 120 0.79 5 AL2 88 200 400 120 0.79 5 AL3 118 200 400 120 0.79 5 AL3 148 200 400 120 0.79 5 RL2 58 200 400 120 1.18 5 RL3 58 200 400 120 1.57 5 WL2 58 250 400 120 0.79 5 WL3 58 300 400 120 0.79 5 HL2 58 200 450 120 0.79 5 HL3 58 200 500 120 0.79 5 Fig. 12. The Performance of the ACCB at Different Loading Ages: (a) Comparison of the Deflection of the ACCB, (b) Comparison of the Stress of the  CIC on the Composite Interface, (c) Comparison of the Stress on the bottom of the Beam, (d) Comparison of the Stress at a Holding Time of  365 d 3468 Y. Fang et al. 12(c), and a comparison between the stress on the top of the  beam, on the composite interface, and on the bottom of the beam  at a holding time of 365 d is shown in Fig. 12(d). The variation of the stress indicates that the tensile stress of  CIC on the composite interface and on the bottom of the beam  increases with time. Moreover, the comparison reveals that the  stress on the concrete section increases as the loading age of the  PRC extends. This is also caused by a larger DSC. The curvature  (θ) is proportional to the DSC (d), and an increase in the DSC  enlarges θ and σ1. Thus, the tensile stress on the ACCB increases  with the loading age of the PRC although σρ decreases slightly.  The tensile stress on both parts of EL1 is the last to reach the  standard strength, which indicates that the tensile concrete in  ACCBs with a smaller loading age of the PRC has a smaller  failure probability and more time to failure, e.g., cracking. Therefore,  to control the section stress, reducing the loading age of the PRC  is effective. 4.2 Reinforcement Ratio Figure 13 shows the performance of the ACCB at different reinforcement ratios. According to Fig. 13, the deflection of the ACCB at a holding time of 365 d decreases by 3.7% when the reinforcement ratio  doubles; the variation of the tensile stress on the PRC also follows the  same trend. The stress on the bottom of the beam has a lower growth  rate when the reinforcement ratio increases at the preliminary stage of  the loading, but it turns to the opposite after a holding time of 140 d.  At a loading time of 365 d, the tensile stress on the bottom of the CIC  decreases by 0.01%, and the stress on the bottom of the beam  enlarges with the increase in the reinforcement ratio. It is evident that  a variation in the reinforcement ratio of the tensile reinforcement has  a negligible effect on the section stress on the ACCB and a negative  effect on the reduction in the failure probability of the tensile  concrete; the method of increasing the reinforcement ratio of the  tensile reinforcement is less effective and economical. 4.3 Section Dimensions Figures 14 and 15 depict the comparisons of the deflection of  and the section stress on the ACCB with different widths and  heights, respectively. It is evident that increasing either the width Fig. 13. The Performance of the ACCB at Different Reinforcement Ratios: (a) Comparison of the Deflection of the ACCB, (b) Comparison of the  Stress of the CIC on the Composite Interface, (c) Comparison of the Stress on the bottom of the Beam, (d) Comparison of the Stress at a  Holding Time of 365 d KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering 3469 or the height of the beam is beneficial to the reduction of the  deflection of the ACCB under shrinkage and creep. However,  increasing the height of the beam has little effect on the reduction  of the stress on the bottom of the CIC, while increasing the width  of the beam is more effective. As for the stress on the bottom of  the beam, both methods are favorable to the reduction of the  stress and keep the stress below the standard strength. According to the above results and analysis, in the design of  assembled concrete composite members with shrinkage and  creep, the most effective optimization method for reducing the  deflection of the ACCB is to increase the height of the beam; the  second most effective method is increasing the width of the  beam. However, increasing the reinforcement ratio is not suitable  for the reduction of the deflection of the ACCB. Additionally, the  most effective method for controlling cracks is increasing the  width of the beam, followed by increasing its height. However,  enlarging the reinforcement ratio is the least effective method of  controlling cracks. In addition to the design optimization of the  section of the composite beams, the optimization of the loading  ages of the PRC in ACCBs is effective. 4.4 Surface Area in Contact with Atmosphere In addition to the abovementioned variables that affect the  deflection of and the section stress on the ACCB, it is obvious  that the beams with different positions in the structure have  different deflections and section stresses under shrinkage and  creep even if they have exactly the same loading age, section  dimensions, and reinforcement ratio. The larger the contact area between the concrete and the  atmosphere is, the more apparent the effect of shrinkage and  creep becomes. In a structure, there are three main types of  contact between the cast-in-place segment and the atmosphere:  1) three faces are in contact with the atmosphere (as in this case).  2) Two faces are in contact with the atmosphere. 3) One face is in  contact with the atmosphere. The details are provided in Fig. 16. EL1 is considered as an example. The curves of the deflection  of the beam with time in these three cases are plotted in Figs.  17(a), 17(b), and 17(c). It is clear that as the surface area in  contact with the atmosphere decreases, the deflection of the  beam declines substantially; this decrease is mainly caused by  the reduction of w2 because w1 is controlled by the load and the Fig. 14. The Performance of the ACCB at Different Widths of the Beam: (a) Comparison of the Deflection of the ACCB, (b) Comparison of the Stress  of the CIC on the Composite Interface, (c) Comparison of the Stress on the Bottom of the Beam, (d) Comparison of the Stress at a Holding  Time of 365 d 3470 Y. Fang et al. creep. The decrease in the surface area in contact with the  atmosphere reduces the creep coefficient of the CIC from 1.89 to  1.59, a decrease of approximately 0.3. Moreover, the cast-inplace segment exhibits a small stiffness and little influence on the  deflection of the beam; therefore, w1 decreases marginally. On  the other hand, w2 is mainly controlled by the DSC. When the  surface area in contact with the atmosphere decreases, the  shrinkage strain of the CIC declines, so w2 decreases. When there  is only one contact surface, w2 decreases to less than zero after a  holding time of 200 d as shown in Fig. 17(c) because the shrinkage strain of the CIC (189 µε) is smaller than that of the PRC (197  µε) during that time. In other words, the DSC reduces the  deflection of the beam. In summary, the surface area in contact  with the atmosphere mainly affects the variation in w2. The cross-sectional stress is calculated as shown in Figs. 17(d), 17(e), 17(f), and 17(g). As the surface area in contact with  the atmosphere increases, the tensile stress on the section  decreases significantly. This is because the shrinkage strain of  the CIC declines with the increase in the surface area in contact  with the atmosphere, resulting in the reduction of the differential  shrinkage and the tensile stress on the concrete because of the  steel bars. Where only one side of the beam is in contact with the  atmosphere, the tensile stress on the bottom of the beam and on  the CIC is much lower than the standard strength, that is,  reducing the surface area in contact with the atmosphere is  beneficial to the reduction of the failure probability of the tensile  concrete. Compared with the beam of three faces which are in  contact with the atmosphere, the tensile stress on the bottom of  the beam and on the CIC is reduced by 75.0% and 32.2%,  respectively, at a holding time of 365 d. Therefore, reducing the  surface area in contact with the atmosphere, for example by Fig. 15. The Performance of the ACCB at Different Heights of the Beam: (a) Comparison of the Deflection of the ACCB, (b) Comparison of the Stress  of the CIC on the Composite Interface, (c) Comparison of the Stress on the Bottom of the Beam, (d) Comparison of the Stress at a Holding  Time of 365 d Fig. 16. The Surface Area of the Beam in Contact with the  Atmosphere KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering 3471 changing the position of the assembled concrete composite  members, is favorable to controlling of the section stress and is  considered as an effective optimization method for the design of  assembled concrete composite members when considering shrinkage and creep. In addition, an atmospheric contact area with some  special conditions such as a high-humidity environment is also  more beneficial to the reduction in the deflection of and the stress  on the beam than the natural environment (Huang et al., 2020). Fig. 17. The Performance of the ACCB with Different Surface Areas in Contact with the Atmosphere: (a) Comparison of the Total Deflection of the  Beam, (b) Comparison of Deflection w1, (c) Comparison of Deflection w2, (d) Comparison of the Stress on the top of the Beam, (e) Comparison of  the Stress of the CIC on the Composite Interface, (f) Comparison of the Stress of the PRC on the Composite Interface 3472 Y. Fang et al. Therefore, if a large surface area in contact with the atmosphere  cannot be avoided or the position of the beam cannot be  changed, wet curing measures can be taken to reduce the contact  area of the member with the atmosphere. 5. Optimization Design Framework Based on Theoretical Calculation Method The effects of shrinkage and creep are rarely considered in the design  of assembled members. The calculation method proposed in this Fig. 17. (continued): (g) Comparison of the Stress on the Bottom of the Beam, (h) Comparison of the Stress at a Holding Time of 365 d Fig. 18. The Actual DSC at the Composite Interface of the ACCB at a Loading Age of: (a) 68 d, (b) 98 d, (c) 128 d, (d) 158 d KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering 3473 paper can be utilized to optimize the design of assembled members  by considering the effects of shrinkage and creep so as to prevent  problems caused by shrinkage and creep such as concrete cracking. 5.1 Simplification of Theoretical Calculation Method The actual DSC cannot be determined directly by a simple mathematical operation, and it needs to be calculated with the  assistance of MATLAB software according to Eq. (15), which is  not convenient for optimization design. Thus, the feasibility of  the simplification is discussed in this context. As for the case in Section 3.2, the calculation results of d are  shown in Fig. 18. Fig. 19. The Framework for the Review and Optimization of the Reinforced Concrete Structures 3474 Y. Fang et al. Two meaningful results can be concluded: First, d is significantly smaller than D. Second, the concrete creep reduces the DSC  substantially, which is favorable to the reduction of the crosssection stress on the beam. Especially, for the beams with a  smaller loading age of the PRC such as 68 and 98 d, the changing  trend becomes descending, and the difference between d and D enlarges. Therefore, using the actual DSC, rather than D, for  calculating σ1 is more accurate because of the proportional  relationship between σ1 and the DSC. Also, it is necessary to  determine the actual DSC in the calculation of the section stress  on the beam. However, the calculation of the deflection of the beam is  different. Comparing Eqs. (4) with (20) demonstrates that the  proportion of the difference between d and D in w2 is relatively  small. In this case, the difference between corrected w2 (calculated by Eq. (20)) and uncorrected w2 (calculated by Eq. (4)) is less  than 2% in the calculation of the deflection of the beam; hence,  the accuracy of using Eq. (4) for practical design is acceptable.  Therefore, Eq. (4) can be used as a simple formula to calculate  the deflection of the ACCBs without determining the actual DSC  with the assistance of MATLAB software. 5.2 Framework of Design Optimization The design processes of normal reinforced concrete components  include the section design based on the ultimate bearing capacity  limit state and the section review based on the serviceability limit  state. Due to the effects of shrinkage and creep, the risk of the  additional deflections or unexpected cracking of the ACCS  should be checked. The review or optimization of the ACCB can  be carried out by utilizing the theoretical method developed  herein. In this context, the framework is proposed in Fig. 19. For an ACCB, after the ultimate bearing capacity limit state  and the serviceability limit state fulfill the requirements, the  long-term deflection of and the stress on the beam need to be  calculated by the method proposed above. If the long-term state  cannot satisfy the requirements, the design optimization such as  the optimization of the section dimensions or the optimization of  the construction process should be applied. If the construction of  the structure is completed or the structure cannot be optimized  due to other reasons, the surface area in contact with the  atmosphere can be reduced to satisfy the requirements. A case study is carried out for the review or optimization of  ACCBs. The optimization of beam AL2 in Section 4 is discussed.  The design parameters of the beam are identical to those in Fig.  11 and Table 4. The beam is also under a uniformly distributed  load of 5 kN/m. The mid-span deflection of and stresses on the  beam under shrinkage and creep are shown in Fig. 12. It can be  learned from Figs. 12(b) and 12(d) that the stress of CIC on the  interface is larger than the standard tensile strength. It means the  concrete at that position would probably crack after 365 d holding time. Therefore, it’s necessary to propose a design optimization  or construction optimization for the beam if cracking is not  allowed during operation. Three different possible optimization methods (OM) are proposed  according to the results of sensitivity analysis in Section 4. OM1  is to reduce the loading age of PRC from 88 d to 58 d. OM2 is to  enlarge the width of the beam from 200 mm to 250 mm. OM3 is the  combination of OM1 and OM2 (58 d PRC loading age and 250  mm beam width). Following the framework in Fig. 19, the review  results of the beam before and after optimizations are shown in  Table 5. The calculation of items of ultimate limit state is  according to GB 50010 (2010). Table 5 shows that the beam AL2 meet the requirements of serviceability limit state. However, cracks appear during sustained  loading period. And all the three optimizations could avoid the  appearance of cracks because the long-term stresses at that  position have reduced below the tensile strength of concrete  (2.20 MPa). The long-term deflection has also decreased. In  addition, the comparation of the three optimizations indicates  that combinations of two or more optimizations would be more  beneficial for the long-term performance of ACCBs. There are  no decreases appearing in items of ultimate limit state and the  serviceability after optimizing. This case study indicates that  optimization based on long-term state is objectively necessary,  and also the proposed framework is effective. 6. Conclusions An assembled concrete composite structure contains a large  number of concrete bonding interfaces. The different shrinkage  and creep behaviors of the old and new concrete can pose the  risk of the additional deflections or unexpected cracking of the Table 5.

The traditional structural design neglects the section  review or section optimization process considering the DSC.  Thus, a theoretical calculation method based on the mean  curvature method is proposed herein. Although the long-term  deflections of and section stresses on the beam can be calculated by  FEM, a simpler theoretical method is needed in the process of  design. The accuracy of the developed method is verified by the  experimentation and the numerical simulation. Also, the feasibility  of the simplification of the theoretical method is discussed at the end. The results of the parametric sensitivity analysis can be  helpful for designers to select the best approaches for optimization.  The optimization of the section dimensions is the most effective  way to reduce the deflection of the beam and control the risk of  cracking through the discussed ways. In addition to the design  optimization of the section dimensions of the assembled concrete  composite beam, the selection of a reasonable loading time is  effective. Another interesting finding of this work is that the  surface area of the CIC in contact with the atmosphere is  favorable for reducing the deflection of the beam and for  controlling the section stress on the beam. This indicates that the  beams in various positions in the structure perform differently. An optimization design framework based on the theoretical  calculation method is proposed at the end of this work. The  section review or the section optimization considering shrinkage  and creep is added into the traditional section design process.  The framework demonstrates that the section review or the  section optimization is quite convenient and effective. This  process can helpfully be employed to control the risk of the  additional deflections or cracking of the assembled concrete  composite beams during the long-term operation of buildings. The research has some limitations. The actual DSC needs to  be determined with the assistance of MATLAB software and  could not be simplified by replacing with D in the calculation of  section stresses. Checking tables of the actual DSC could be  made for some typical sections with common load cases in future  studies, which would probably simplify the calculation. In the future, calculation method of deflection of and stress on  ACCBs with other constraints would be studied. The long-term  performance of cantilever ACCBs and clamped ACCBs is also  worth studying and discussing. Since the behavior of cantilever  beams could be considered as a reverse bending to simply  supported beams, and the clamped beams could be considered as  a combination of simply supported beams and cantilever beams,  the approach for the development of the calculation method in  Section 2 could be also adopted with some further analysis.  Thus, the design optimization framework would be further  improved.
