Introduction It has  been  known  for  more than  30 years  that  very  fine  particles  are  difficult  to fluidize  due to their  cohesive  properties_  Interparticle  forces  have been  a separate  subject  of  study  for  many more years,  but  the  first  systematic  study  of  interparticle  forces  in fluidized  beds  only  appeared  in  1966  111.  It  included  fine  particles  which  are  natural ly cohesive  because  of  their  small  size  as we1 1 as 1 arger  particles  made artificially  cohesive  with  additives. The term “fine  particles”  is  somewhat  vague,  and in his  classification  of powders  into  groups  according  to their  fluidization  behaviour,  Geldart  CZI distinguishes  between  free-flowing  easy-to-fluidize  group A  powders  and cohesive  difficult-to-fluidize  group  C. A considerable  amount of  research  has been  devoted  to group  A powders  largely  because  most commercial  fl uidi zed bed catalytic  reactors  use them;  our  basic  scientific  understanding  of  these  powders  has been  advanced  significantly  by the  research  of  Rietema  and co-workers  131 and of  Donsi,  Massimi lla  and their  co-workers  143,  but the  fluidization  behavi our of  group  C powders  has attracted  much less  attention  t1,51.  Interest  has  increased  recently  [6-,7,81  under  the  stimulation  of  commercial  processes which  wish  to make use of  them. The interparticle  forces  in group  A powders  are small  compared  with  the  hydrodynamic  forces  acting  within  the  fluidized  bed and their  influence  is  beneficial  since  they  are  responsible  for  the  expanded  dense  phase  which  1 imi ts the  growth  of bubbles;  for  this  reason  group  A powders  should  perhaps  be called  “~1 i ghtly  cohesive”  _ In group  C the  interparticle  forces  are substantially  larger  than  the hydrodynamic  forces, 0032597  O/%4/$3.00  0 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed  in The Netherlands 26 the  gas cannot  readily  separate  particles  and channelling  occurs,  giving  poor  fluidization.  A better  knowledge  of  the  factors  which  influence  the transition  between  groups  A and C is  of  practical  as  well  as scientific  interest. i  t  1  50  100  560  1000  scoc  % r;?xlzp The work reported  here  forms  part  of  a study  financed  by ICI PLC aimed  at locating  the  group  A/C border1 ine,  and at understanding  the  extent  to which  the  gas and particle  characteristics  influence  the  fluidization  properties.  In this  paper  we concentrate  on some aspects  of  the  fl ui dization  behavi our of  cohesive  solids  which  appear  to have  pone  unnoticed,  or unreported,  hitherto,  and we compare  and contrast  them  with  the well-known  behaviour  of  group  A powders _ Choice  of  fluidization  criteria  and of  powders  and gases The major  differences  between  group  A and B powders  are summarised  in  table  1 and the most useful  quantifiable  criteria  are the  ratio  U  /U,  the bed expansion  ratio  H/Hb,,-, and the bed deaeration  rateBi nceMB  rlF’ it  is  1 argely  the  interplay  of hydrodynamic  and interparticle  forces  which  gives  rise  to these  differences,  we thought  that  measuring  the  same parameters  in cohesive  solids  would  be informative.  We also  decided  to measure  the  rate  of  entrainment  and the  discharge  rate  through  an orifice  since  both  are  of  practical  and scientific  interest.  Entrainment  depends,  inter  alia,  on bubbling  behaviour  as well  as on  particle  interaction  in the bed and freeboard_ In principle  all  the  particle  and gas properties  shown in table  2  should  be independent  variables,  but  in practice  one is  limited  to  what is  commercially  avai 1 able  and can be modified  cheaply  so as to  provide  batches  of several  kilograms.

The distributor was made up of two layers of  thick IBECCl papers glued at the edges with "Copydex" adhesive, and  suppuri;edbya perforated zinc pla te to aive a total pressure drop of  about 650 mm H20 at a superficial gas velocity of 0.01 ms-I_ Bed  pressure drop was measured using a 1 m long stainless steel probe of  3 mm diameter and 1.6mmnominal boreT'nis had a 1 mm diameter hole  (covered with filter paper to prevent ingress of powder) 6 mm above  the sealed lower end. The probe was inserted so that it touched the  surface of the distributor and the other end was connected directly  to a water or mercury manometer. In addition, a pressure tap in the  wall of the bed 0.063 m above the distributor provided an alternative  for bed pressure drop neasurementsA transparent scale was stuck on  the bed wall to provide direct bed expansion measurements_ Tne same  bed was used for the bed collapse experiment but with the additional  arrangement of a solenoid valve which was positioned in the air line  immediately before the bed inlet. This arrangement allowed the fluidizing gas supply to be interrupted virtually instantaneously. The relative humidity of the fluidizing air was controlled by a simple  humidification rig, which consisted of two columns, one filled with  water and packed with raschig rings, and the other filled with silica  gel_ A 0.08 m diameter glass column with a total height of about 2.6 m was  erected for the elutriation test. For simplicity, vacuum cleaner bags  were used to collect the carryover instead of using a cyclone. The  presence and extent of electrostatic forces were measured by suspending an earthed copper rod above the bed_ The greater the electrostatics,  the greater the mass of solids adhering to the rod_ Results and discussion Incipient fluidization and bubbling  One of the difficulties associated with fluidization of the very fine  powders of group C characteristics is that the incipient fluidization  velocities are so low (0.01 cm/s) that sintered porous plates cannot  give the high pressure drop required for even fluidization, and distributors have to be made upfromseveral layers of paper. Even so, it  quickly became apparent thatanymeaningful measurement of Up.IF  became  virtually impossible for cohesive powders because the bed pressure  drop was non-reproducible; it varied with time due, probably, to the  creation, destruction and re-formation of channels. As we fluidized  the more cohesive powders we experienced increasing difficulty in  deciding what was U ; even at velocities of several centimeters per  second no clear bub@es could be identified_ We therefore decided to  ignore both U.  ible measurem!!&.?id uMF'  and to concentrate rather on other reproduc. Dry et al. C71 have a!so recently reported similar  experiences_ Bed pressure drop deficiency in a free-flowing group A powder, providing the distributor has an  adequate pressure drop, the pressure drop across the fluidized bed is 30 within  one or two per  cent  of  the  theoretical  value;  that  is  AP  A/k’=  1.  It is well-known  that  the  actual/theoretical  pressure  dr&  ratio  decreases  as powders  become  more cohesive  and this  effect  can be seen  in figure  2 where  cohesiveness  is  increased  by (a)  decreasing  particle  size,  and (b)  increasing  the  relative  hum?;dity  (%RH)  of  the  fluidizing  air.

Bed expansion There  is  a significant  difference  in the  slope  of  the  expansion  curves  of  the  two aluminas  shown in figure  3.  The reduction  in the bed expansion  observed  just  above  UMB with  the  group  A powder  occurs because  the voJume of  the  dense  phase  In the  bubbling  bed is  reduced  more  rapidly  than the bubble  hold-up  increases.  This  reduction  in dense  phase  voidage  is  caused  because  the  interparti  cle  contacts  are  continually  disrupted  by the  passage  of bubbles  and the  consequent  increase  i n overal 1 powder  ci rcul ation _ In the more cohesive  powder,  the  stronger interparticle  forces  a77ow the microvoids  described  by Massimilla  and Donsi  191 to increase  in number and/or  size.  Numerous horizontal  and sloping  cracks  or channels  form,  and the bed expands  without  true  bubble  formati on _ Some small  bubbles  do form and al though  at the wall  they  can be seen  to  “wipe  out”  the  cracks)  the  cracks  reform  with  a  different  inch inati on and length.  The addition  to the bed of moisture  in the  form of  air  of high  RH decreases  bed expansion  at low velocities  but  increases  it  at higher  velocities.

Ignoring  the  data  for  the  first  two seconds  when the bubbles  in the  bed escape  to  the  surface,  the  group  A powder  collapses  at a constant  rate.  The cohesi ve powder  co1 1 apses  rapidly  for  the  first  10 s _ or so,  and then  at  a gradually  decreasing  rate,  The group  C powder  may remain  in a sl i ghtly  aerated  state  for  a considerable  period  many minutes  or even  several  hourswith  the pressure  at the  bottom  of  the bed decaying  very  si owly i ndeed. The different  bed structure  in the  two types  of  powder  influences  the  way in which  deaeration  occurs.  In the  coarser  alumina,  the particles  nearest  the  distributor  qui ckly  def lui dize  and assume a voi dage  close  to that  of  a gently  poured  packed  bed.  The packed  bed  increases  in  thickness  whilst  the  powder  above  it  remains  fluidized  at a velocity  similar  to that  in the  dense phase  in the bubbling  bed.  We suggest  that  in the  cohesive  powder,  the gas in the cracks and microvoids adjacent  to cracks  leaves  the bed rapidly,  and the  horizontal/s1  opi ng  cracks  cave-in  giving  rapid  bed collapse.  Subsequently  the  rate  of  collapse  is  control  led  increasingly  by the  rate  at which  gas  can escape 32 to a vertical  channel  from microvoids  in the bulk  of  the  powder.  A  group  A powder made cohesive  by moisture  also  gives  a collapse  curve  having  a simi 1 ar shape  to that  of  a group  C powder.

The mass flow  rate  of  free-flowing  fluidized  powders  through  orifices  can be expressed  as: M = Cd. pBMF $ (Do kZp>  ‘a where k % 4 And 0.4  < Cd < 0.7. and H is  the height  of  povJder above  the  orifice. The 70 urn alumina  follows  equation  (1)  in that  the  line  has a slope  of  0 -5,  but the  cohesive  a? uminas  deviate  considerably.  Their  mass  discharge  rates  at low bed heights  are  considerably  below  that  of  the  coarse  alumina  but  approach  it  for  deeper  beds.  The data  from the  10 urn alumina  assumes  a slope  approaching  0.5  at H > 0.6  m though  it  is much steeper  at low bed heights. The pressure  drop  across  a fluidized  bed of  cohesive  solids  can be up  to 20% 1 ower than  theoretical  but  even  after  applying  the appropriate  corrections  for  this  and also  for  the  lower  bulk  densi ties  of  the  finer  powders,  there  is  no difference  in the  slope  of  the  lines.  Our  qualitative  explanation is that thefinerpowders  pass through the orifice in an agglomerated  condition  and have  an effective  particie  size  larger  than the  ultimate  particle  size.  As the  agglomerates  move into  the  region  near  the  orifice  they  are  subject  to shear  stresses.  These  shear  stresses  will  influence  the  size  of  the  agglomerate  the  larger  the  stress,  the small er the  aggl omerate.  Cal cul ati ons using  equation  (113  and assuming  that  there  are no agglomerates  at H = 1 m, gives  effective  particle  sizes  for  the  5 urn powder ranging from 330 vrn at  Ii = 0.2 m down to  15 urn at H = 0.8  m. El utri ati on Elutriation  from fluidized  beds  is  a complex  affair  and the mechanisms  are not well  understood  even  for  free-flowing  sol ids.  They include  the  ejection  of  solids  into  the  freeboard  by bubbles,  hydrodynamic  interparticle  effects  (shielding),  collisions  and momentum interchange,  aggl omerati on,  and wall  effects.  Electrostatic  effects  can have  an  influence  particularly  on the batch  el utriati  on of  porous  poVJders  , and  the  %RH influences  electrostatics  by changing  the  conductivity  of  the  air.  It was therefore  necessary  to control  %RH and to  assess  the  electrostatics  as described  earlier. It  is  generally  assumed  from the  trend  of el utriation  data  relating  to group  A and B solids  (a)  that  as the  average  particle  size  of  the  bed decreases  the elutriation  rate,  Ri , wi 11 increase,  (b)  that  the  el utri ation  rgte  of  a sieve  fraction  increases  as the  size  goes  down,  i.e.  Rs l/d..  However,  from figure  6 it  can clearly  be seen  that  the  fifie  cohegi ve alumina  powders  have  significantly  smaller  carryover  rates  than  the much coarser  group  A alumina.  Increasing  the IRH of  the  gas fl ui dizing  a non-porous  powder  decreases  the  carryover,  as shown  in figure  7,  and changes  the  shape  of  the  curve. It  is  not  possible  to say with  absolute  certainty  whether  it  is  the  poorer  fluidization  in the bed which  is  responsible,  though  this  does  appear  likely.  It could  be argued,  as Yerushalmi  and Cankurt  Ill]  do,  in the  case  of  fast  fluidisation,  that  considerable  agglomeration 34 10 !

Ratio of tap to aerated bulk density  Our research programme included measurement of the internal angle of  friction of the powders using a modified Jenike shear cell, behaviour  of the powders in a rotating fluidi  zed bed 1127 and measurement of the  vibrated and aerated bulk densities, pBT and +A_ Results of only the  last are presented in this paper; the other results are available  eisewhere 1133. The aerated density is obtained by pouring the powder  through a vibrating sieve and allowing it to fall a fixed height into  a cylindrical cup_ The tapped density is then measured by causing the  cylinder to fall 180 times through a known height whilst, at the same  time, making powder additions to keep the cylinder full_ In a more extensive programme, in which the humidity was carefully controlled, and which will be reported fully elsewhere, it was found that  althoughboth oBT and pBA vary with RH, the ratio ogT/ogA (sometimes  called the Hausner ratio) is virtually independent of  %RH. This is  rather convenient since it means that powders can be tested quickly  under ambient conditions without the need to take special precautions_  In figure 9, we have tried to draw together the observations from all  33 powders whose behaviour varied from very free flowing to very  cohesive under dry conditions (%RH), as judged by the tests described  earlier. It is clear that there is a critical range for qBT/oBA_ Powders having  a ratio > l-4 exhibit distinctly cohesive behaviour and shouid be considered as group C powders; a fine powder with a ratio less than l-25  is certainly in group A, whilst those in the range 1.25 l-4 may  exhibit some properties of both groups- Conc7usions  A study of the fluidization behaviour of fine powders (~70 urn) has  revealed some striking differences between cohesive group C and freeflowing group A_ In particular, when bed expansion and elutriation  rates are plotted against gas velocity, and deaeration height is plotted against time, the two powder groups exhibit quite different  characteristic curves. In addition.mostgroup A powders can be made  to behave like group C by fluidizing them with air of relative humidity  in the range 60 90%. A simple standardised test from which the tap density/aerated density  can be obtained gives a good indication of the likely fluidization  characteristics when the powder is fluidized by air of low humidity_ 36 ALUMINA  9G 0  20  LO  60  SO  100 Relative  Humidity  (%I Expansion ---I-- I  e Figure  8 Aerated and tap densities  as  functions off  re Zative ht37iiditg  _ ?
