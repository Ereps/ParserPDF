WASp  deficiency causes characteristic microthrombocytopenia and lymphoid–myeloid dysfunction, the severity of which usually depends  on the residual levels of WASp expression and function. WAS affects  all the hematopoietic cellular compartments, which explains the  broad range of associated clinical manifestations1–3. The Zhu score4  is commonly used to stratify disease severity. The most severe phenotype is characterized by susceptibility to severe infection, bleeding, eczema, autoimmunity and a risk of malignancy5,6. Without a  curative treatment for WAS, most patients lacking functional WASp  do not survive beyond their second or third decade of life7. The most severe, early-onset, life-threatening form of WAS is  characterized by profound, treatment-refractory thrombocytopenia6. At the other end of the WAS severity spectrum, X-linked  thrombocytopenia (XLT) represents a milder disease entity. It is primarily characterized by microthrombocytopenia, although patients  with XLT can also develop classical complications of WAS. The first-line treatment for WAS is allogeneic hematopoietic  stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with a human leukocyte antigen  (HLA)-compatible donor. Although transplantation was initially  associated with substantial mortality and morbidity rates, outcomeshave substantially improved8–11. In the most recently described  cohort of patients with WAS having undergone HSCT12, the overall survival rate was 94% for those treated before the age of 5 years.  The rate fell to 66% in those treated at an older age. The outcome  after HSCT is influenced by the level of donor engraftment. Mixed  donor chimerism after HSCT is associated with an increased risk  of poor immune reconstitution and autoimmunity. In particular,  donor myeloid engraftment below 50% is associated with persistent thrombocytopenia8,9,11,12. In addition, between 10% and 20% of  long-term survivors have active autoimmune complications, which  are closely linked to the level of mixed chimerism (<70%)8,9. For patients lacking a suitable donor for HSCT, other treatment  options have been developed. These include haplo-identical HSCT  and gene therapy via the infusion of gene-corrected autologous  hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Haplo-identical transplantation  is an attractive option because a family member is almost always  available as a donor for pediatric patients. Moreover, the high morbidity and mortality rates initially associated with this approach8 are   now falling11–13. The gene therapy approach bypasses many of the remaining problems associated with haplo-identical HSCT, in particular the toxicity of a full conditioning regimen and the risk of graft-versus-host  disease. A rationale for gene therapy has been provided by natural somatic reversion events reported in a number of patients withLong-term safety and efficacy of lentiviral  hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell gene therapy  for Wiskott–Aldrich syndromeA.

Here, we present comprehensive, long-term follow-up results (median follow-up, 7.6 years) (phase I/II trial no. NCT02333760) for eight patients with  WAS having undergone phase I/II lentiviral vector-based gene therapy trials (nos. NCT01347346 and NCT01347242), with a  focus on thrombocytopenia and autoimmunity. Primary outcomes of the long-term study were to establish clinical and biological safety, efficacy and tolerability by evaluating the incidence and type of serious adverse events and clinical status and biological parameters including lentiviral genomic integration sites in different cell subpopulations from 3 years to 15 years after gene  therapy. Secondary outcomes included monitoring the need for additional treatment and T cell repertoire diversity. An interim  analysis shows that the study meets the primary outcome criteria tested given that the gene-corrected cells engrafted stably,  and no serious treatment-associated adverse events occurred. Overall, severe infections and eczema resolved. Autoimmune  disorders and bleeding episodes were significantly less frequent, despite only partial correction of the platelet compartment.  The results suggest that lentiviral gene therapy provides sustained clinical benefits for patients with WAS.NATuRE MEDiCiNE | VOL 28 | JAnuAry 2022 | 71–80 | www.nature.com/naturemedicine 71Articles Nature MediciNeWAS14–16. In such cases, the accumulation of WASp-expressing lymphocytes constitutes direct evidence of the in vivo selective advantage of genetically competent cells. A previous trial using a gamma  retroviral vector with a viral promoter provided evidence for the  efficacy of gene therapy for WAS17. Unfortunately, this treatment was  associated with serious adverse events related to vector-mediatedinsertional mutagenesis in all of the patients18. To minimize mutagenic side effects, subsequent phase I/II clinical trials have been  based on the use of a self-inactivating lentiviral vector expressing  WASp under the control of a minimal endogenous promoter19–21.  These studies have confirmed the efficacy of gene therapy for WAS,  and no major safety concerns were highlighted.02,0004,0006,0008,0009,000Months after gene therapyCD3+ per µl05001,0001,5004,000CD56+ per µl05001,0001,5002,000 4,000 8,000CD19+ per µl05,00010,00015,000CD15+ per µl0123Months after gene therapyVCN01234VCN0123VCN00.20.40.6 1.02.03.0VCN0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100110 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100050100150Months after gene therapyMonths after gene therapy Months after gene therapy0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100110 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100Months after gene therapyMonths after gene therapy Months after gene therapy0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100110 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100Months after gene therapy Months after gene therapy0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100110 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 1000 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100Months after gene therapy% CD3+WASp+020406080100% CD19+WASp+050100150% CD56+WASp+Patient 1Patient 2Patient 4Patient 5Patient 6Patient 7Patient 8Patient 9b a cFig. 1 | immune reconstitution after gene therapy. a, Measurement of the total CD3+ T cell, CD19+ B cell, CD56+ natural killer (nK) cell and CD15+  neutrophil counts in blood at regular time points after gene therapy.

NCT01347346 and NCT01347242) (ref. 20). Here, we  report comprehensive, long-term follow-up efficacy and safety data  (4–9 years after gene therapy; median, 7.6 years) for these and two  additional patients (including a young adult patient) enrolled after  the first report.Results Clinical presentation. We previously reported on non-randomized,  open-label, phase I/II clinical studies (based on a lentiviral gene  therapy vector) involving seven pediatric patients (referred to hereafter as patients 1–7) with severe WAS. The patients were treated  at Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital (Paris, France) and at Great  Ormond Street Hospital (London, UK)20. One patient (patient 3)  died 7 months after gene therapy from pre-existing complications  of infection, as reported previously20. Since the initial report, two  additional patients treated at the Royal Free London Hospital  and Great Ormond Street Hospital have been followed for at least  4 years after gene therapy and were included in the present study  (patients 8 and 9). Patient 8 presented with severe cutaneous vasculitis, arthropathy, lymphoproliferation and chronic kidney disease  requiring intensive immunosuppressive treatment and splenectomy  before gene therapy22. Patient 9 had presented with gastrointestinal  bleeding, severe eczema, recurrent infections, cytomegalovirus viremia and failure to thrive. All but one of the patients (patient 6) had  a WAS score of 5. The patients’ clinical characteristics are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell engineering and transplantation. Autologous hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) were  transduced ex vivo with the LV-w1.6 WASp self-inactivating lentiviral vector23 and immediately reinfused without cryopreservation,  as described previously20. The graft was collected from mobilized  peripheral blood (n = 4) or bone marrow (n = 4) (Supplementary  Table 1). At the time of gene therapy, the median patient age was  5.25 years (range, 0.8–30 years). The median vector copy number  (VCN) per CD34+ cell in the drug product was 0.91 (range, 0.6– 2.8). All of the patients underwent non-myeloablative conditioning  with busulfan and fludarabine, as described previously20, together  with anti-CD20 therapy in one patient (patient 7). The median dose  of CD34+ cells infused was 7.05 × 106 (range, 2–15 × 106) per kilogram of body weight. No serious adverse events were recorded during or after the cell infusion. Neither delayed neutrophil recovery  nor a requirement for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was  observed after transplantation.Clinical outcomes after gene therapy. After gene therapy, the  patients were regularly evaluated over a period of at least 4 years.  At the time of this interim analysis (cut-off, 1 October 2020), the  median follow-up was 7.6 years (range, 4–9 years). The patients’  clinical outcomes are summarized in Supplementary Table 1 and  Extended Data Fig. 1. The progressive reconstitution of hematopoietic lineages in all  of the patients was accompanied by a reduction in the frequency  and severity of infections. Patient 7 had fluctuating reactivation ofEpstein–Barr virus infection, but this was already present before  gene therapy and did not require treatment. All of the patients discontinued their pre-gene therapy anti-infection prophylaxis, except  for penicillin after splenectomy (and following myeloablative chemotherapy for UK patients). Five patients (patients 4, 5, 6, 8 and  9) discontinued immunoglobulin replacement therapy between 12  and 24 months after gene therapy. Eczema manifestations resolved  in all but one patient (patient 7), who nevertheless had a marked  reduction in the severity of eczema, with a decrease in the SCORing  Atopic Dermatitis score24 from 52 to 15. Prior to gene therapy, all of the patients had severe microthrombocytopenia, in some cases associated with life-threatening episodes of cerebral or gastrointestinal bleeding (patients 2, 4, 5, 7 and  9). After gene therapy, none of the patients had spontaneous, severe  bleeding despite below-normal platelet counts and none required  platelet transfusions. Patient 8 was treated at the age of 30 years. After gene therapy,  autoimmune manifestations, inflammatory manifestations and  infections were markedly less frequent. He was able to discontinue immunoglobulin replacement therapy and immunosuppressants and showed protective levels of post-vaccination antibody  titers. Immune reconstitution and gene marking levels were stable.  Four years after gene therapy, this splenectomized patient died of  concomitant pneumococcal sepsis and H1N1 influenza. Patient 9 was treated at the age of 11 months. Twenty-one months  after gene therapy, he presented with hematuria, proteinuria and  edema. He was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome, and a renal  biopsy showed mild diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, immune complex-mediated. He was successfully treated  with steroids, rituximab and mycophenolate mofetil. He is no longer  taking immunosuppressants and is in good health. With regard to inflammatory manifestations, patient 2 had developed very debilitating lower extremity vasculitis before gene therapy,  which required wheelchair use. He underwent gene therapy at 16 years  of age, followed by a marked improvement in vasculitis. He recovered the ability to walk but still had sequelae, including relapsing– remitting episodes of pain that partially responded to non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs and immunoglobulin replacement therapy.  A marked improvement was observed after treatment with the  human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist anakinra (100 mg per day);  this treatment is ongoing and well tolerated. Patient 4 had a single episode of single-joint (knee) inflammation 5 years after gene therapy, but recovered fully after conventional  treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs. Three years later, he presented with moderate swelling of the ankles after an influenza vaccination, but this fully resolved after a short steroid treatment.Myeloid reconstitution after gene therapy. All of the patients had  stable engraftment in the first 3 weeks after gene therapy. The level of  gene marking in CD15+ and CD14+ myeloid cells reached a median  of 8.9% (range, 1–100%) after 4 years of follow-up and corresponded  to the level of gene marking in the engrafted CD34+ HSPCs in the  bone marrow (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Except in patient 9, this level  did not increase further over time and was markedly lower than in  the drug product (Extended Data Fig. 2b). The level of gene marking in CD15+ cells tended to correlate with the number of corrected  CD34+ cells per kilogram infused (Extended Data Fig. 2c).Fig. 2 | TCRβ repertoire analysis. a, Shannon diversity of the TCrβ clonotypes analyzed in patients with WAS (P1, P2, P4–P8) at months 24 and 48 of  post-gene therapy follow-up (left) and in four healthy donors (HD1–HD4) (right). b, The Spearman correlation between the TCrβ Shannon diversity at  month 24 and the number of corrected CD34+ cells infused per kilogram, for each patient.

In all of the treated  patients, the T cell counts increased over time and reached normal  age-matched reference values (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 3). A  gradual enrichment in WASp-positive CD3+ T cells demonstrated the  proliferative and functional advantage of gene-corrected cells over  non-corrected cells (Fig. 1). In all of the patients, the naive T cell and  signal joint T cell receptor excision circle (sjTREC) counts were similar to those observed in age-matched controls, highlighting active  thymopoiesis (Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). Using next-generation  sequencing (NGS), the polyclonal T cell antigen receptor-beta (TCRβ)  repertoire was analyzed in seven patients 24 and 48 months after gene  therapy (Fig. 2). The repertoire diversity was similar to that observed  in healthy donors, except for in the three patients (patients 1, 6 and  8) who received the lowest dose of gene-corrected HSPCs (Fig. 2a).   The TCRβ repertoire diversity was correlated with the numberof corrected HSPCs per kilogram infused (Fig. 2b); it was stable, and  no clonal expansion was detected (Fig. 2c). To gain further insights into the functional recovery of the T cell  compartment, we characterized the immune synapse in expanded  T cells from four patients after gene therapy and compared these  post-gene therapy data with the pre-gene therapy data, when available (Fig. 3). As shown for a representative patient in Fig. 3, confocal microscopy assessment of T cells forming conjugates with  monoclonal anti-CD3 antibody-coated P815 cells showed that the  immune synapse assembly was aberrant before gene therapy. The  WASp-deficient T cells were elongated, lacked F-actin enrichment at  the contact area and featured various types of actin-rich protrusions  outside the contact area. Furthermore, the intensity of high-affinity  lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) staining was  lower than for control cells.

WASp was located  in the cytoplasm, with enrichment in the synapse (as seen in healthy  donors). The post-gene therapy T cells had normalized immune  synapse features, including the cell shape, F-actin enrichment and  intensity of high-affinity LFA-1 (except in patient 1’s T cells, in  which the intensity of high-affinity LFA-1 remained low). Overall, T cell compartment analysis documented robust  immune reconstitution after gene therapy, which was associated  with sustained clinical benefit.B cell immune reconstitution after gene therapy. The B cell count  increased progressively over time after gene therapy and reached  age-matched reference values in all of the patients at last follow-up  (Fig. 1). An enrichment in WASp-positive B cells was observed at the  last follow-up, relative to baseline. This enrichment demonstrated the  advantage of gene-corrected B cells over non-corrected cells, albeit to  a lesser extent than for T cells. Accordingly, kappa-deleting recombination excision circle (KREC) counts, indicative of B cell neogenesis, were in the normal range (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Phenotype  analysis showed progressive normalization of the distribution of  different subsets in the B cell compartment, with an increase in the  switched memory B cell subset in particular (Fig. 4a). No expansion  of the CD21lowCD38low B cell subset (including autoreactive B cells)  was observed when compared with in-house reference values from  healthy donors. The immunoglobulin production level increased  progressively over time: the IgA levels reached age-matched reference values in all treated patients, although IgM levels remained  below normal in four patients (Extended Data Fig. 5). At the time of  our previous report20, only two patients (patients 4 and 5) had been  able to discontinue immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Since  then, three additional patients (patients 6, 8 and 9) have discontinued immunoglobulin replacement and had normal levels of IgGproduction (Fig. 4b). When available, the presence of protective levels of post-vaccination antibodies was highlighted (patients 4, 5 and  8; Supplementary Table 2). Patient 2 remains on immunoglobulin  replacement therapy for the sequela of vasculitis, as described above. For four patients, we were able to analyze WASp expression in the B cell subsets after gene therapy and compare it with  the level in healthy donors (Fig. 4c). All of the patients had a  greater proportion of WASp-expressing cells in the B cell memory subsets (including switched (CD19+CD27+IgD−) and marginal zone (CD19+CD27+IgD+) B cells) than in naive B cells  (CD19+CD27−IgD+); this was confirmed by a greater mean fluorescence intensity for WASp in the memory subsets than in the naive  cells. These patterns of WASp expression in B cell subsets were also  observed in healthy donors (n = 5) analyzed concomitantly. To  further characterize these subsets, we analyzed the VCN in sorted  memory (CD19+CD27+) and naive (CD19+CD27−) B cells. We  observed significantly greater gene marking in memory B cells than  in naive B cells (Fig. 4d). Furthermore, we compared the transduction level in subpopulations (when available) sorted concomitantly  from peripheral blood and from bone marrow samples after gene  therapy. We observed higher VCN levels in B cells from peripheral blood than in B cells from bone marrow, which suggests that  gene-corrected B cells have a selective advantage after egress from  the bone marrow (Extended Data Fig. 2a). To investigate laboratory variables related to autoimmune features, samples collected before and after gene therapy were compared with regard to a panel of circulating autoantibodies. Before  gene therapy, anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) were detected in  all of the patients tested. Remarkably, the ANA titers after gene  therapy were null or insignificant.

Circulating and  platelet-bound antiplatelet autoand alloantibodies were studied  separately (only after gene therapy) and were detected in patients 2,  4 and 7 (Supplementary Table 4). Taken as a whole, these data suggest that gene therapy is able to  correct the B cell compartment in WAS, with evidence for a selective  advantage over time for genetically corrected B cells.Platelet homeostasis and function after gene therapy. After gene  therapy, platelet count increased over time and reached values of  more than 140,000 platelets per µl at last follow-up in three patients  (Fig. 5). These include patients 1 and 8, in whom thrombocytopenia  was stably corrected after splenectomy (at 36 months after gene therapy and before gene therapy, respectively), and patient 9 (the patient  with the highest engraftment of gene-corrected myeloid cells). For  the other patients, the platelet count remained significantly below  the normal range: from 20,000 to 50,000 platelets per µl for patients 2,  4 and 6 and below 20,000 platelets per µl for patients 5 and 7 (Fig. 5a   and Extended Data Fig. 6a). Patient 2 had a splenectomy before gene  therapy at the age of 8 years. This led to a temporary increase in the  platelet count (up to 80,000 platelets per µl), followed by fluctuations  and the observation of accessory spleen on ultrasound (Extended  Data Fig. 7). For all of the patients, the platelet count 3 years after  gene therapy tended to correlate with the level of gene marking in  CD15+ cells (Fig. 5b). Patients (including those with below-normal  platelet counts) did not present with spontaneous bleeding after  gene therapy and no longer required platelet transfusions. Patients  4 and 7 received preventive platelet transfusions prior to scheduled  surgery (7 years and a few months after gene therapy, respectively).  Following a family decision, patient 5 started treatment with eltrombopag, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TRA), 6 years after gene  therapy, without significant improvement in the platelet count. Six  and a half years after gene therapy, patient 7 presented with a drop in  the platelet count (5,000 platelets per µl) and developed cutaneous  and mucosal ecchymosis. Treatment with the TRA romiplostim was  initiated and led to a moderate increase in the platelet count (up to  34,000 platelets per µl). To better characterize the platelets after gene therapy, a detailed  functional and phenotypic analysis was performed on four patients  from the same center (Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital). Platelet  size was evaluated using flow cytometry, which is more accurate  than automated blood cell counting, especially for small platelets.  The results for the patients treated with gene therapy were compared  with those for healthy donors and non-treated patients with WAS.  We found that the platelets of the patients treated with gene therapy  were larger than those of the non-treated patients with WAS but  were still smaller than those of healthy donors (Fig. 5c). Moreover,transmission electron microscopy ultrastructure analysis showed  that the platelets of the patients treated with gene therapy were elongated; this contrasted with the disk-like shape of resting platelets from  healthy donors (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 6b). The α-granule  density was also slightly lower than normal, due to the smaller cell size  (Extended Data Fig. 6c). To further evaluate hemostasis and platelet  function after gene therapy, we studied the aggregation of washed  platelets (Fig. 5e). At a low thrombin concentration (80 mU ml−1), all of  the patients had severe defects in platelet aggregation compared with  healthy donors. Aggregation was less abnormal at a higher thrombin  concentration (150 mU ml−1), which suggests a partially functional  response to agonist. Similar results were also observed after activation  with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (Extended Data Fig. 6d). To further evaluate the degree of platelet correction, WASp expression was  evaluated using western blotting (Fig. 5f). All of the patients treated  with gene therapy had suboptimal WASp expression (15–32% of that  measured in healthy donors). The level of WASp expression after gene  therapy was nevertheless higher than that observed in non-treated  patients with WAS (5–10% of healthy donor values). Next, we used an immunofluorescence assay to quantify WASp  expression (Extended Data Fig. 6e) in individual platelets and to estimate the percentage of WASp-positive platelets and the level of WASp  expression per platelet (Fig. 5g). The proportion of WASp-positive  platelets ranged from 60% to 84% in the patients treated with gene  therapy and from 16% to 19% in non-treated patients with WAS   (Fig. 5g, left). It must be noted, however, that one of the two  non-treated patients harbored a mutation resulting in residual WASp  expression. However, the level of WASp expression per platelet in the  gene therapy-treated patients was significantly lower (by 45–67%,  P < 0.001) than in healthy donors (Fig. 5g, right). This indicates that,  although a relatively high proportion of platelets re-expressed WASp  after gene therapy, the level of WASp expression in individual platelets remained suboptimal. Last, antiplatelet antibodies were found in  patients 2, 4 and 7 after gene therapy, as mentioned above. Taken as a whole, these platelet measurements show that the  gene therapy procedure only partially corrected the platelet compartment. However, this suboptimal recovery benefited the patients  and was sufficient to prevent episodes of spontaneous hemorrhage.Integration site and replication-competent lentivirus analyses.  Vector integration site analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear  cells (PBMCs) from the eight patients revealed a diversity of integration sites, with between 169 and 15,691 different sites (as analyzed  using Illumina sequencing; Extended Data Fig. 8a). We observed  high, time-stable values of the Pielou diversity index (a normalized  version of the Shannon diversity index) for integration sites in the  various patients25,26 (Extended Data Fig. 8b), reflecting successfulFig. 5 | Hemostasis and platelet profile after gene therapy. a, Change over time in the platelet count for each patient after gene therapy. b, The Spearman  correlation between platelet count and the level of gene marking (VCn) in CD15+ neutrophils after 3 years of follow-up for each patient (apart from P8,  for whom the platelet count was corrected following splenectomy before gene therapy).

An analysis of the most abundant clones  over time also highlighted strong, stable polyclonal reconstitution  (Extended Data Fig. 8c), with no concerning clonal expansion. The  monitoring of replication-competent lentivirus occurrence that was  conducted as part of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)  mRNA evaluation has been consistently negative at all time points  tested in all of the present patients.Discussion We have previously reported preliminary data on seven patients  with WAS who were treated with gene therapy and whose follow-up  ranged from 9 to 42 months20. In this updated report, we provide a  comprehensive long-term analysis of data from the longest follow-up  reported to date, with a median of 7.6 years (range, 4–9 years), and  include two additional patients treated since the last report. The  present study confirms our earlier results and provides additional  evidence of the long-term efficacy of gene therapy for WAS, as well  as the safety track record. Here, sustained multilineage engraftment  of gene-modified cells was observed in the peripheral blood and the  bone marrow. In turn, this led to increasing expression of WASp  in the patients’ cells and clinical resolution of severe eczema and  susceptibility to recurrent infections. In line with these results, T cell  function was restored, as shown by the recovery of immune synapse  assembly and normal naive T cell count and functions after gene  therapy. The T cell compartment was reconstituted in the patient  treated at the age of 30 years, suggesting that gene therapy for WAS  is also a treatment option in adult patients22, despite the continuing  risk associated with splenectomy27. In parallel with the robustness of T cell reconstitution, a normalized B cell compartment was observed, in line with previous  studies28,29, as shown in particular by the increasing level of WASp+  switched memory B cells over time and the age-matched level of  KRECs. Five patients were able to discontinue prophylactic antibiotic treatment and immunoglobulin replacement therapy while  achieving normal post-vaccination antibody titers. The level of  gene marking was greater in lymphoid than in myeloid cells. This  is consistent with the strong proliferative and/or survival advantage  conferred by WASp expression in the lymphoid compartment, as  predicted by earlier observations in mice and in patient cells30,31.  This was also reported in the WAS gene therapy trial conducted in  Milan with the same vector21. No graft failure or treatment-related adverse events were  observed after gene therapy. Vector integration site analyses showed  that the insertion profile was safe and diverse, with no concerning  clonal expansion. In the present study, we focused on two major concerns in patients  with WAS: thrombocytopenia and autoimmunity. The mechanisms  of thrombocytopenia in WAS include defective central thrombocytopoiesis and increased peripheral destruction32–34. A recent study has  highlighted functional and phenotypic abnormalities and an altered  proteomic profile in WASp-deficient platelets34. This senescent profile accelerates the peripheral destruction of platelets. After gene  therapy, the patients had a marked decrease in the frequency and  severity of spontaneous bleeding episodes. Platelet count increased  over time and reached more than 140,000 platelets per µl in three  patients (that is, two splenectomized patients and the patient with  the strongest engraftment of gene-corrected myeloid cells). Platelet  count in the other patients remained subnormal, perhaps because of  the low WASp expression in this lineage or the residual autoimmunity in some patients, as recently described in a conditional mouse  model33. Given that the gene marking level in the myeloid lineage  reflects the engraftment of corrected HSCs in the bone marrow, one  can propose that the initial quantity of HSCs infused and the level  of gene marking in the cell product influence the recovery of platelet count. A higher level of gene correction might also improve the  migration of true stem cells into the bone marrow. The low degree ofmyeloid chimerism, despite adequate VCN and HSC counts in the  infused drug product, might also be due to the defective migration  of WASplow HSCs described previously35. After gene therapy, a few autoimmune manifestations were  observed: persistence of lower extremity vasculitis (in patient 2),  new nephrotic syndrome occurrence (in patient 9) and presence  of antiplatelet antibodies (in patients 2, 4 and 7). The level of circulating autoantibodies detected before gene therapy (including  ANA and vasculitis-related autoantibodies) was normalized after  treatment. Further improvement in autoimmune features after gene  therapy might result from the inclusion of an anti-CD20 agent in  the conditioning regimen. The main difference with the results from the Milan trial19–21 concerned platelet count. The count was below the normal range in both  studies but lower in the present patients. This disparity might be due  to differences in the severity score and age of the treated patients  and in the VCN of the infused drug product. Disease prior to gene  therapy was more severe in the present trial than in the Milan trial,  as evidenced by the median Zhu score (5 versus 4, respectively).  Moreover, the present patients were older at the time of gene therapy than those in the Milan trial (median age of 5.25 years versus  2.2 years, respectively). Last, the median VCN was lower in the present trial than in the Milan trial (0.9 versus 2.4, respectively). Further lentiviral vector optimization (with a stronger promoter,  for example) has been considered as a possible means of enhancing  WASp levels in platelets36–38. Alternatively, enhancement of the ex  vivo transduction procedure might usefully result in higher levels  of gene correction of WAS HSPCs in terms of both cell frequency  and the VCN. In conclusion, gene therapy is a safe, efficacious treatment for  patients with WAS who lack a suitable HSCT donor. More efficacious and more reliable transduction protocols and conditioning  regimens are likely to improve outcomes further, particularly with  regard to platelet recovery, for which the advantages of intrinsic correction are less apparent.Online content Any methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of  author contributions and competing interests; and statements of  data and code availability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/ s41591-021-01641-x.Received: 29 January 2021; Accepted: 24 November 2021;   Published online: 24 January 2022References  1.

We have previously reported on a  non-randomized, open-label, phase I/II clinical study (based on a lentiviral gene  therapy vector) involving seven pediatric patients with severe WAS. Details of  the gene therapy study design and procedures have been reported previously20.  The patients were treated at Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital (Paris, France;  ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01347346) and at Great Ormond Street Hospital  (London, UK; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01347242). Patients were enrolled  in the Long Term Safety Follow up of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Gene Therapy  for the Wiskott–Aldrich Syndrome (WASFUP) study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier  NCT02333760), which was designed to follow patients for an additional 13 years  after the initial gene therapy study. The WASFUP study protocol was approved by  the UK and French drug regulatory agencies and the appropriate investigational  review boards, such as the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee in the United  Kingdom and the Comité de Protection des Personnes in France. A CONSORT  flow diagram detailing enrollment of the patients is available in the Supplementary  Information. Data were collected manually and transferred to the Altizem Society  for data management through Clintrial software. The primary endpoint for the initial WAS trials (NCT01347346 andNCT01347242) was to assess the efficacy of HSC gene therapy in patients with  WAS, based on clinical improvement in at least one of the following parameters  (depending on the patient symptom profile at study entry): eczema status,  the frequency and severity of infections, bruising and bleeding episodes, and  autoimmune disorders and the number of disease-related days of hospitalization.  The thee secondary objectives were to assess the safety of HSC gene therapy  in patients with WAS, the efficacy of HSC gene therapy for the progression of  microthrombocytopenia and the need for its treatment, and the efficacy for other  hematological variables, including WASp expression and reconstitution of humoral  and cell-mediated immunity. The eligibility criteria were male sex (any age); severe WAS (clinical score  3–5) or absence of WASp in PBMCs determined on western blotting and flow  cytometry; molecular confirmation using WAS gene DNA sequencing; lack of  HLA-genotypically identical bone marrow or 10/10 or 9/10 antigen HLA-matched  unrelated donor or HLA-matched cord blood after a 3-month search; signed  informed consent or assent by the parent, guardian or patient; willingness to return  for follow-up (only for patients who have received previous allogenic HSCT); failed  allogenic HSCT; and contraindication to repeat transplantation. The exclusion criteria were HLA-genotypically identical bone marrow; 10/10  or 9/10 antigen HLA-matched unrelated donor or HLA-matched cord blood;  contraindication to leukapheresis; contraindication to bone marrow harvest;  contraindication to conditioning medication; and HIV positivity. The six primary endpoints for the long-term safety follow-up trial  (NCT02333760) were the incidence and type of serious adverse events and, more  specifically, the incidence and nature of delayed events (such as malignancies,  hematologic events, autoimmune events and mortality continuously for the  duration of the post-gene therapy follow‐up study); the safety of the gene therapy  procedure for gene transfer analysis at yearly post-gene therapy visits (lentiviral  integration sites in different cell subpopulations, quantification of the VCN in  sorted cell populations using real-time quantitative PCR); the safety of the gene  therapy procedure with regard to the absence of replication-competent lentiviruses  (RCLs) at yearly post-gene therapy visits; the change in medical conditions; the  key medical events related to WAS (eczema status, infections, bleeding symptoms,  autoimmune manifestation); and the hematological and cell-mediated and humoral  immunity reconstitution. The three secondary endpoints were change in the need  for associated treatments at the yearly post-gene therapy visit (immunoglobulin  replacement therapy, antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral drugs, transfusions  etc.); the representation of TCR families using PCRs, TREC assays and the TCR Vβ  panel after gene therapy; and bone marrow integrity (optional) after gene therapy  via bone marrow aspiration. The WASFUP study (NCT02333760) was designed  as a longitudinal descriptive study without interim analysis. It has included nine  eligible and consenting patients between October 2014 and November 2019.  Considering the duration of the study (13 years), an intermediate evaluation of  the majority of primary and secondary endpoints (delayed events, key medical  events, biological parameters of vector expression and insertion, RCL, platelet  and immune reconstitution), as well as additional exploratory investigations  on T cells and platelets, was conducted for the first eight patients having at least  4 years of follow-up after gene therapy. These eight patients described here were  included in the WASFUP study between 29 October 2014 and 13 December 2015.  Some prespecified biological and medical parameters of the WASFUP study were  not reported, such as duration of hospital stay, humoral or cellular responses  to antigens, and bone marrow exploration, given that the clinical study is still  ongoing. The two inclusion criteria were enrollment in the initial phase   I/II WAS trial conducted in France and the United Kingdom and signed informed  consent by the parents, guardians or patients. The only exclusion criterion was  unwillingness in parents, guardians or patients to return for the follow-up   study period. Written informed consent or assent was obtained after the benefits and risks of  the trial had been explained to the patients or their parents or legal guardians. The  study was carried out in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.Patients were included in the present study if they had at least 4 years  of follow-up. One patient (patient 3) died 7 months after gene therapy from  pre-existing complications of infection, as reported previously20, and was therefore  not included in the present study. Since the initial report, two additional patients  treated at Great Ormond Street Hospital have been followed for at least 4 years  after gene therapy and so were included in the present study (patients 8 and 9).  Data were obtained from blood samples provided by patients with WAS after gene  therapy (patients 1–9) at routine hospital visits and were compared with data from  blood samples from non-treated patients with WAS (WAS 1–3) and adult healthy  donors (healthy donors 1–11). Blood samples from healthy individuals were  obtained from the French Blood Establishment (Etablissement Français du Sang  (EFS); ref: C CPSL UNT-N°18/EFS/031, and collection DC-2015-2488 approved  by the ethics board Comité de Protection des Personnes CPP Sud Ouest et  Outre-Mer II (France)) and from adult healthy volunteers upon informed consent,  in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki; the study participants  were informed about the anonymous use of their personal data. Patient WAS 1  corresponds to patient WAS 2 (male, 5 years) in the 2002 study by Dupré et al.39.  This patient carries a 2-nucleotide deletion (AG) in exon 4 (position 484–485) of  the WAS gene resulting in a stop codon (codon 167). Patients WAS 2 and WAS 3  are currently followed at Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital in Paris; sampling  was obtained during regular visits at the hospital, upon informed consent.  Peripheral blood samples from these patients were obtained in accordance with  the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki (including informed consent). Published  age-matched reference values were used for lymphoid subsets40, neutrophils41  and immunoglobulins42. Internal age-matched reference values were generated  and used for sjTRECs and sjKRECs (pediatric, n = 20; adult, n = 199). The  CD21lowCD38low B cell subset data for patients after gene therapy were compared  with in-house reference values from healthy controls (n = 30) analyzed with the  same gating strategy. The diagnosis of WAS was confirmed by genetic testing.Outcomes. Since our initial report, we have regularly collected data on a range  of clinical and laboratory variables: immune reconstitution, the VCN and WASp  expression in sorted myeloid and lymphoid populations, and integration site  profiles. T cell correction was evaluated using real-time quantitative PCR assays  of sjTRECs, and the TCR repertoire was evaluated using NGS. In four patients,  immune synapse assembly was studied before and after gene therapy. Platelet  function and phenotype were comprehensively characterized for four gene therapy  patients, non-treated patients with WAS and healthy donors. We recorded changes  over time in B cell count and function, including subpopulation phenotype,  WASp expression in B cell subsets, VCN in the memory (CD19+CD27+) and  naive (CD19+CD27−) compartments, KRECs, immunoglobulin production and  post-vaccination titer. Patients were tested for a panel of autoantibodies (including  antiplatelet antibodies) before and after gene therapy, when possible. Age-matched  reference values were added for the different immunological parameters, based on  pediatric reference ranges40,41.Isolation of mononuclear cells. In line with the trial protocol, peripheral blood  was sampled regularly during follow-up, while bone marrow was sampled  once after gene therapy (unless required more frequently for medical reasons).  Mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood or bone marrow using  standard Ficoll gradient separation. Lymphocyte subpopulations were studied  using fluorochrome-coupled antibodies (BD Bioscience, Miltenyi Biotec), and the  absolute lymphocyte count was determined using Trucount Tubes (BD Bioscience),  as described previously20.Immunophenotyping and sorting of hematopoietic subpopulations. Cells  were stained with specific, directly labeled monoclonal antibodies, according  to the manufacturer’s instructions and as described previously20. An eight-color  FACSCanto II cell analyzer and FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences) were  used for flow cytometry analysis and cell sorting, respectively, according to the  manufacturer’s instructions. Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo  software (TreeStar).Proliferation assays. T cell lymphoproliferation was assayed by measuring  the incorporation of tritiated thymidine in response to a challenge with  phytohemagglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich) or tetanus toxoid (Staten), as described  previously20.Clonogenic assay and DNA extraction. Erythroid burst-forming unit and  granulocyte–macrophage colony-forming unit progenitors or precursors  were grown in semisolid methylcellulose medium supplemented (or not)  with erythropoietin (Methocult H4435 and H4535, respectively; STEMCELL  Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Single colonies were  picked for DNA extraction.Gene marking. Gene marking in sorted subpopulations was monitored via VCN  analysis, as described previously20.TREC and KREC analysis. sjTRECs and sjKRECs were quantified using a  real-time PCR assay, as described previously43. In brief, a 1:200 or 1:2,000 dilutionNATuRE MEDiCiNE | www.nature.com/naturemedicineArticles Nature MediciNeof an initial multiplex PCR amplification was quantified in duplicate for each  of the different primer–probe sets on a ViiA7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied  Biosystems). sjTREC and sjKREC counts are given per 150,000 cells (around 1 µg DNA)  after normalization against the albumin gene content. Data are expressed as the  log10 count per 150,000 PBMCs.TCR repertoire analysis. To analyze the TCR repertoire, genomic DNA was  extracted from blood samples or PBMCs. The TCRβ repertoire was assessed with  one-step NGS using 100 ng DNA and EuroClonality-NGS amplicon primers44. The  DNA was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq system, using 2 × 250-bp v2 chemistry.  Figures were prepared with R software (https://www.R-project.org/). The Shannon  diversity index was calculated using the vegan package. Circos plots showing the  various V-gene and J-gene combinations were designed using the circlize package.Detection of autoantibodies. Serum samples from all participants were screened for  ANAs using HEp-2000TM commercial slides (Immunoconcept). HEp-2000TM cells  are HEp-2 cells that overexpress Ro60 antigens. Serum samples were diluted 1:80 in  PBS and incubated for 25 min at room temperature in a humid chamber. After two  washes in PBS, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG  (immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, Immunoconcept) for another 25 min in  the dark. After two more washes in PBS, the slides were counterstained with Evans  blue and assembled with glycerol and coverslips. Specific antibodies were detected  using a multiplex ENA (extractable nuclear antigen) assay on the FIDIS instrument  (Theradiag), an anti-DNA ELISA (DiaSorin), a Farr assay (Trinity Biotech) and/or  an anti-nucleosome ELISA (Werfen). Samples were also screened for anti-neutrophil  cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) using commercial NOVA LiteH ANCA ethanol or  formalin slides. Thirty microliters of a sample diluted 1:20 was spotted on each well,  incubated for 25 min and washed with PBS buffer (Immunoconcept). Cells were  subsequently incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-human immunoglobulin for  25 min in the dark. After two washes in PBS, slides were counterstained with Evans  blue and assembled with glycerol and coverslips. Indirect immunofluorescence  screening for anti-tissue antibodies on triple rodent tissue (stomach, liver,  kidney; Biosystems) was performed with IgG antibodies against smooth muscle,  mitochondria, LKM1, parietal cells, LC1, SLA and intrinsic factor. Serum samples  were diluted 20-fold in PBS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a moist  chamber. After two washes in PBS, the slides were incubated with FITC-conjugated  goat anti-human IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies. Slides were examined under a  fluorescence microscope. To minimize subjective bias, two observers had to agree on  the results of the ANCA assay, the ANA assay and the indirect immunofluorescence  screening for anti-tissue antibodies.Evaluation of T cell immune synapse assembly. T cells were expanded  by stimulation of PBMCs with irradiated PBMCs and Epstein–Barr  virus-immortalized B cells (JY cells), interleukin (IL)-2 (100 U ml−1) and IL-15  (5 ng ml−1) in RMPI medium containing 5% human serum. As an internal control,  a T cell line derived from a previously described patient with WAS (referred to here  as WAS 1, corresponding to patient 2 in the report by Dupré et al.39) was added to  the samples from the gene therapy-treated patients. To rule out selection bias in the  in vitro expansion step, we confirmed that the VCN at the time of immune synapse  analysis was similar to that measured at sampling (median VCN, 1.29 and 1.15,  respectively). Immune synapse assembly was evaluated as described previously45  by mixing T cells with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (10 μg ml−1 OKT3,  eBioscience)-coated P815 cells and depositing the resulting cell conjugates on  poly(l-lysine)-coated slides with preformed reaction wells (Marienfeld). Unlabeled  a24 mAb (Biolegend) that binds to LFA-1 in its high-affinity conformation was  added at a concentration of 2.5 µg ml−1 for 10 min at 37 °C. The conjugates were  then fixed, permeabilized and stained with phalloidin-AF488 (Invitrogen) and  anti-WASp rabbit mAb (Abcam, ab75830). The anti-LFA-1 and anti-WASp  antibodies were then visualized with anti-mouse AF647-coupled and anti-rabbit  AF564-coupled secondary antibodies (Invitrogen), respectively. Slides were  examined under an LSM-710 confocal microscope (×63/1.4 oil immersion  Plan-Apochromat objective, Carl Zeiss). To calculate the integrated density of  WASp and high-affinity LFA-1, images of randomly selected T cell:P815 cell  conjugates were acquired and then analyzed with ImageJ software.Platelet characteristics and function. Preparation of washed platelets. Venous  blood from healthy donors or patients was collected in 10% ACD/A buffer  (75 mM sodium citrate, 44 mM citric acid and 136 mM dextrose, pH 4.5). As  described previously46, platelets were washed in the presence of apyrase grade  VII (100 mU ml−1, Sigma-Aldrich) and prostaglandin E1 (1 µM, Sigma-Aldrich)  to minimize platelet activation. The platelet count was then adjusted to  3 × 108 platelets per ml in Tyrode’s buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 0.3 mM  NaH2PO4, 1 mM MgCl2, 5.5 mM glucose, 5 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′2-ethanesulfonic acid, 12 mM NaHCO3 and 2 mM CaCl2, pH 7.3).Flow cytometry evaluation of platelet size. Platelet size was evaluated using a BD  Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) by recording the forward scatter  parameters.Platelet aggregation. Platelet aggregation was monitored by measuring light  transmission through a stirred suspension of washed platelets (3 × 108 platelets  per ml) at 37 °C, using a Chrono-Log aggregometer (Chrono-Log), as  described previously47. Platelet aggregation was triggered by bovine thrombin  (Sigma-Aldrich) and ADP.Western blotting for WASp expression. Washed platelets (3 × 108 platelets per  ml) were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer (10 mM HEPES, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol,  5 mM EDTA). The proteins were reduced by incubation with 25 mM dithiothreitol,  separated by electrophoresis using NuPage 4–12% Bis-Tris Protein gels (Invitrogen)  and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were incubated with mouse  anti-WASp primary antibody (1 µg ml−1, clone B-9; Santa Cruz) or mouse  anti-CD41 (0.2 µg ml−1, clone SZ22, used as a loading control for normalization;  Beckman Coulter). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced  chemiluminescence detection reagents (Perbio Science) and a G:BOX Chemi XT16  Image System and were then quantified using Gene Tools v4.03.05.0 (Syngene).Immunofluorescence assay of WASp expression. Glass coverslips were coated  with 100 μg ml−1 human fibrinogen (HYPHEN BioMed SAS) in PBS (0.01 M  H3PO4, 0.154 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 ± 0.2) at 4 °C overnight and then blocked with 5%  BSA. Washed platelets (3 × 106) were stimulated with ADP (20 µM, to induce full  platelet spreading; Sigma-Aldrich), plated on fibrinogen-coated glass coverslips  and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing, platelets were fixed for 15 min  with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked with  1% BSA and stained with primary mouse anti-WASp antibody (4 μg ml−1, clone  B-9; Santa Cruz). The primary antibody was detected using a goat anti-mouse IgG  Alexa Fluor 555 conjugate (4 µg ml−1, Invitrogen), and platelet morphology was  assessed by labeling cytoskeletal F-actin with Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin (0.3 µM,  Invitrogen). Last, the coverslips were mounted on slides, and immunofluorescence  images were acquired on an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon, Eclipse 600).  WASp expression was quantified using ImageJ.Transmission electron microscopy. Washed platelets were fixed by incubation for  1 h at room temperature in 1.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2),  centrifuged for 10 min at 1,100g and washed once in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Platelets  were stored in 0.2% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C until processing for standard transmission  electron microscopy analysis of platelet morphology, as described previously48.Detection of antiplatelet autoantibodies and/or alloantibodies. For each  patient analyzed, 15 ml blood was collected in EDTA tubes for the detection  of autoantibodies bound to platelet glycoprotein complexes. Serologic assays  for circulating autoantibodies and/or alloantibodies were performed on 10 ml  blood collected in dry tubes. Patients’ antiplatelet antibodies were detected using  monoclonal antibody-specific immobilization of platelet antigen technique,  according to the manufacturer’s instructions (apDia)49.Integration site analyses. Vector integration sites were amplified, sequenced  and analyzed using the INSPIIRED pipeline, as described previously50–52. The  Pielou diversity index (a normalized version of the Shannon diversity index) was  calculated using the vegan package.Statistical analysis. Results are reported as the mean ± s.d. or the median, unless  stated otherwise. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism6  (GraphPad). Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance followed by a post  hoc test, as indicated in the figure legends. The threshold for statistical significance  was set to P < 0.05. The statistical significance of the Spearman correlation between  parameters was evaluated using the cor.test function in R software.Reporting Summary.

Clinical and laboratory features of patients with WAS  before and after GT: light pink: no disease; pink: mild disease; light red: moderate disease; red: severe disease. Eczema was graded with the SCOrAD  tool24. Infections and bleeding were graded in terms of recurrence and severity. Vasculitis was assessed according to the WAS severity scoring system4.  Thrombocytopenia was defined as follows: grade 3 for a platelet count <10,000/µL; grade 2 between 10,000/µL and 20,000/µL; grade 1 between  20,000/µL and 50,000/µL. Grey box: not applicable. Statistical significance was determined by t test (***p < 0.001); nS: not significant.NATuRE MEDiCiNE | www.nature.com/naturemedicineArticles Nature MediciNeExtended Data Fig. 2 | Gene marking level. Panel A, the VCn in the bone marrow (BM, white) subpopulations versus the peripheral blood (black)  subpopulations in patients P2, P4 and P5; Panel B, VCn levels in the initial CD34 + drug product versus myeloid CD15 + cells 48 months after GT. Panel  C, The Spearman correlation between the level of gene marking in CD15 + 48 months after GT and the number of corrected CD34 + cells infused per  kilogram, for each patient. The pvalue (p) was calculated by using two-sided Spearman’s rank correlation test, r is Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient.  A regression line is represented in black, the confidence interval in grey.NATuRE MEDiCiNE | www.nature.com/naturemedicineArticles Nature MediciNeExtended Data Fig. 3 | immunological reconstitution after GT.

Panel A, Images show blood smears performed once for each GT-treated patients (P) or healthy donors  (HDs) after May-Grünwald Giemsa staining. Arrows indicate the platelets. Panel B, TEM analysis of platelet ultrastructure in each patient (P). The boxand-whisker plots show the platelet shape defined as the ratio between the largest diameter and the smallest diameter derived from the TEM images  performed once for each patient. Whiskers represent the upper and lower extreme values, the box correspond to the interquartile range, the center line is  the median and the cross indicates the mean of 100 platelets for patients and 826 platelets for HDs. Statistical significance was determined in a one-way  AnOVA with the Sidak post-test for multiple comparisons. The exact p value was p < 0.0001 for P2, P5, P7 and p = 0.1484 for P4. Panel C, the α-granule  density for each patient was quantified by TEM and the results were shown in box-and-whisker plots. Whiskers represent the upper and lower extreme  values, the box correspond to the interquartile range, the center line is the median and the cross indicates the mean of 100 platelets for patients and 970  for HDs. Statistical significance was determined in a one-way AnOVA with the Sidak post-test for multiple comparisons. The exact p value was p < 0.0001  for all P2, P5, P7 and p = 0.0002 for P4. Panel D, Aggregation of washed platelets induced by ADP (10 or 50 µM) was evaluated once for P2, P5 and P7.  Panel E, WASp expression was evaluated by immunofluorescence in platelets spread onto a fibrinogen matrix after activation with 20 µM ADP. WASp was  detected using a specific antibody. The outlines of spread platelets (represented by the yellow lines) were identified by detecting F-actin with fluorescently  labeled phalloidin.NATuRE MEDiCiNE | www.nature.com/naturemedicineArticles Nature MediciNeExtended Data Fig. 7 | ultrasound assessment of P2. ultrasound assessment of P2, showing three accessory spleens (measuring up to 3 cm in diameter)  in the right hypochondrium.NATuRE MEDiCiNE | www.nature.com/naturemedicineArticles Nature MediciNeExtended Data Fig. 8 | See next page for caption.NATuRE MEDiCiNE | www.nature.com/naturemedicineArticles Nature MediciNeExtended Data Fig. 8 | integration site (iS) analyses.
