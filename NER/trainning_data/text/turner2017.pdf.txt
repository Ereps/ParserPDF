In the area of 3'-end processing, increasing sophistication of first tilingarrays [1-3] and then in next generation sequencing approaches [4-11] has revealed that alternativepolyadenylation (APA) is common in eukaryotic mRNA. APA refers to situations where more thanone potential polyadenylation site exists within the 3’UTR of a mRNA molecule. The result of this3'-end diversity, is a highly expanded regulatory and protein coding repertoire over what waspreviously thought. This provides scope for sophisticated regulatory paradigms in normal growthand development but also means relatively minor changes to mRNA processing can have majorimplications in disease. Here we will discuss the mechanisms of alternative polyadenylation andhow its dysregulation can lead to disease.RNA Processing for Alternative PolyadenylationWhere a nascent mRNA is associated with a single encoded cleavage and polyadenylation site it istermed constitutive polyadenylation (Figure 1a). Such mRNA polyadenylation can be furtherclassified into four distinct groups based on the position of the poly(A) sites (Figure 1b-e). Themost frequent form of APA is tandem 3'UTR APA, where multiple mRNA isoforms are producedthat vary only in the length of their 3'UTR. This version is generally thought to be associated withaltered stability, translational efficiency and/or localisation between 3'UTR mRNA isoforms.Unlike tandem 3'UTR APA, the three other forms involve changes to the protein-coding potentialand therefore exist under the umbrella term, coding site (CDS) APA. In this case, APA events arelinked to alternative splicing and result in distinct protein products between isoforms [12, 13].Firstly, terminal exon APA involves the incorporation of alternative terminal exons into the nascenttranscript through the use of different poly(A) sites between isoforms. Secondly, alternative intronicAPA results from the recognition of cryptic cleavage sites present within introns. This transforms3the normally non-coding region upstream of this site into a composite exon [12]. Lastly, exons otherthan the terminal exon can also contain cryptic poly(A) sites and this is referred to as internal exonAPA. Unlike alternative terminal exon APA, mRNA transcripts produced from internal exon APAwill not possess a stop codon unless the site of cleavage directly follows a T or TG residue that isconverted into a stop-codon by the addition of a poly(A)-tract. In the absence of a stop, no 3'UTR isgenerated, and since A-tracts generate C-terminal poly-lysine tags, any resulting protein productsare likely targeted for decay [14]. Intronic APA can also suffer this fate, in the absence of analternative stop codon within the retained part of the intron, upstream of the poly(A) site. It ispossible for more than one type of APA to exist for a single transcript.Mechanisms of APA Choice: First Come, First Served or Survival of the Fittest?Despite the pervasive nature of APA, how any particular site is specified for cleavage under a givencircumstance is still far from clear. Albeit, several models have emerged. Firstly, it has beenproposed that the proximal cleavage site has an intrinsic temporal advantage over the distal site[15]. Early work by Denome and Cole [16] demonstrated that when two identical polyadenylationsignals were present in the 3'UTR of a reporter construct, increasing the distance between thesesites biased poly(A)-site usage further toward proximal by increasing its temporal advantage.Further, in the ‘enhancer of rudimentary’ e(r) transcript in Drosophila, the proximal cleavage site ispreferentially used in males, whereas the distal site is utilised in females. Switching the sequence ofthese sites did not alter processing [17]. This suggests that position can trump sequence, perhapssimply because a proximal site is transcribed first and therefore has more time to be recognised bythe cleavage and polyadenylation machinery. This idea has become the “first come, first served”model [18].4This proximal advantage can be influenced by the transcriptional elongation rate. When APA wasmonitored in an RNA polymerase II mutant with a slower elongation rate, an aberrant andfunctionally deleterious proximal cleavage site in the Polo transcript of D. melanogaster waspreferentially used [19]. This increased proximal usage was interpreted as allowing more time forthe proximal site to be recognised by the 3'end processing machinery. If poly(A)-site choice thendepends on transcriptional elongation rate, it does not appear to generally correspond to a gene’stranscriptional frequency. In both the human and mouse transcriptome, more abundant genes tend tohave shorter 3'UTRs than their more lowly expressed counterparts [20], a finding that wasrecapitulated in reporter assays where expression from stronger promoters caused a preference forproximal site choice [20]. An exception to this general rule is seen in yeast where strongtranscriptional up-regulation can shift cleavage to a distal site [21]. This might be explained by thecombined effect of very short 3'UTRs in yeast and a high transcriptional rate, such that the 3'-endmachinery ‘misses the moment’ for cleavage at the proximal site, cleaving at a distal site once itgets the chance. Given that the cleavage and adenylation machinery is thought to travel with thepolymerase, perhaps it is only once transcription slows, that end formation can occur.RNA polymerase II pausing has been correlated with switches in cleavage-site choice. Pausing atthe poly(A) signal was shown to be heightened at more highly expressed genes indicating that evena local decrease in elongation rate increases proximal site usage [20]. In a further example of thiskinetic model for poly(A)-choice, deletion of a pause site downstream of the proximal cleavage sitein the IgM gene causes increased use of the more distal site [22]. Such stalls can come fromstructured DNA or RNA elements. Moreover, local chromatin structure and epigenetic marksimpact alternative polyadenylation. Poly(A)-sites are associated with a strong depletion ofnucleosomes whereas downstream regions are enriched for nucleosomes [23-25]. For genes withmultiple sites, the more highly used site was associated with a lower nucleosome occupancydirectly surrounding the poly(A) site and more pronounced nucleosome enrichment downstream5[25]. This may be due to altered RNA polymerase II kinetics or to the presence of a morefavourable environment for efficient assembly of the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery [26].Finally, the fact that epigenetics can play a role is demonstrated in findings that cleavage site choicecan occur in an allele-specific manner. For the mouse imprinted gene H13, the alternative poly(A)-sites are separated by a CpG island. However, this is only methylated on the maternal copy. Thismethylation causes stalling of RNA polymerase II at this site only on the maternal allele, biasingcleavage toward the proximal site, whereas distal sites are selected in the absence of methylation atthe paternal allele [27]. Such findings have prompted an alternative model, being that of ‘survival ofthe fittest’.The “survival of the fittest” model explains changes in cleavage site choice that favour the use ofmore distal poly(A) sites. This model focuses on findings showing that the positioning andefficiency of 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation are largely determined by the interaction ofcleavage and polyadenylation factors with cis elements surrounding the potential poly(A)-site.Several core cis elements within the pre-mRNA appear to be important for 3'-end processing.Proudfoot and Brownlee [28] discovered a conserved AAUAAA hexamer in the region upstream ofthe cleavage site in metazoans (Figure 2). This element has been termed the polyadenylation signal(PAS) and typically occurs within 40 nucleotides of the cleavage site [29]. Although AAUAAA isthe canonical PAS sequence, variants of this hexamer are also observed in metazoans [5, 30, 31]. Ingeneral, deviations from the canonical sequence are associated with weaker PAS [reviewed: [32]].Such variant PAS are more frequent in genes with multiple polyadenylation sites [33, 34] with thecanonical PAS tending to occur at distal sites, and proximal sites often being variant signals [5, 35].In addition to the PAS element, there are distinct U-rich and GU-rich elements located within 100nucleotides downstream (DSE) of the cleavage site [36]. An upstream U-rich element (USE)containing UGUA motifs also tends to be positioned within 40 to 100 nucleotides of the cleavage6site [37]. This cis element pattern is generally conserved, however, higher variation in signals areseen for plants and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [38]. Together, these core motifsalong with auxiliary elements help to define the cleavage site of the mRNA and impact theefficiency of 3'end processing. It has been suggested that these elements act cooperatively so thatthe absence of, or weak sequences for one element may be compensated for by stronger elementsalso present at that cleavage site [38]. To this end, sites lacking a PAS element tend to rely onstrong USEs, DSEs or auxiliary elements to bind the 3'end processing machinery [33, 39].In general, the more distal poly(A) sites utilise stronger cis elements than proximal sites and arealso more likely to be conserved [35]. Thus, proximal sites tend to be weaker than distal sites andare less likely to be recognised by the 3'end processing machinery [40]. However favourable thesequence configuration in cis, the actual site that is chosen for cleavage and polyadenylation isstrongly impacted by the concentration of the core cleavage and polyadenylation factors as well asother proteins.The Influence of Cleavage Factor Concentration on Poly(A)-site choiceA complex machinery of protein factors is involved in the 3'-end processing of eukaryotic pre-mRNA. This consists of 20 characterised proteins in yeast [41] and perhaps more than 80 proteinsin human cells [42]. The core factors involved in cleavage and polyadenylation in these twoorganisms are generally conserved, although there are some differences in the consensus sequencefor PAS recognition and sub-complex organisation [43] (See also Table 1). The mammalian 3'-endprocessing machinery is comprised of four core sub-complexes. These include cleavage andpolyadenylation specification factor (CSPF), cleavage stimulation factor (CstF), cleavage factor I(CFIm) and cleavage factor II (CFIIm) [44]. These factors bind selectively to the cleavage andpolyadenylation site prior to any reaction taking place [43]. The CPSF, CstF and CFIm complexes7recognise and bind to the PAS, DSE and USE respectively [45]. These three factors then recruitCFIIm and other proteins such as the polyadenylation polymerase (Pap), symplekin, andpolyadenylated-binding nuclear protein 1 (PABPN1) to form the 3'-end processing machinery andallow cleavage and polyadenylation to take place [46]. In contrast to the mammalian system, theyeast machinery is comprised of three main complexes including cleavage and polyadenylationfactor (CPF), cleavage factor IA (CFIA) and cleavage factor IB (CFIB) [47]. CFIA containshomologous subunits to those in mammalian CFIIm and CstF, except for the apparent absence of aCstF-50 equivalent [47]. Similarly, CPF contains subunits that are homologous to those inmammalian CPSF. However, these are distributed into the two different sub-complexes, CFII andPFI, which make up CPF [47]. Some factors also appear to be unique to either mammals or yeast.The yeast CFIB factor, for example, appears to lack a homologue in mammals whereas themammalian factor CFIm appears to be absent from yeast [48]. The core cleavage factors in bothmammalian and yeast systems are indicated in Table 1.The effect of this machinery’s concentration on the regulation of APA was first reported byTakagaki et al. [49, 50]. They demonstrated that in resting B cells, the low levels of CstF-64 wereassociated with the preferential use of the distal cleavage site in IgM mRNAs, which, contained astrong CstF-64 binding site. However, during B cell activation, elevated levels of CstF-64correlated with a switch to the proximal site with weak CstF-64 binding capability. This suggeststhat higher levels of this 3'-end processing factor promote the recognition of weaker cleavage siteswhilst limiting concentrations cause the preferential use of the stronger sites. This has since beenshown to be a global trend for CstF-64 [40, 51]. However, the overall effect of CstF-64 knockdownis relatively small compared to the co-depletion of CstF-64 and its variant form CstF-64τ [40]. AsCstF-64τ depletion alone also has a comparatively mild impact on cleavage site switching, thissuggests that CstF-64 and CstF-64τ have at least partially redundant functions [52]. Similarly,reduced levels of the CPSF factor Fip1 or yeast Hrp1 have been associated with increased distal site8usage [53, 54]. In striking contrast to this, depletion of the CFIm subunits CFIm-25 or CFIm-68causes an increased use of more proximal cleavage sites [29, 55-58]. This implies that unlike theother core 3'-end processing complexes, CFIm normally represses cleavage at the proximal site.The cellular balance of 3'-end processing sub-machineries is therefore of critical importance toAPA choice.Together these data indicate that the strength of mRNA cis elements and the concentration of 3'-endprocessing factors together define the pattern of APA for many genes. However, it is of note thatwhen target mRNA affected by changes in cleavage machinery concentrations were compared,there was little overlap, suggesting that 3'-end processing factors each influence the alternativepolyadenylation of a specific subset of genes [53] ( see also Figure 2). Another possibility is thateach different experimental system that has identified shifts in 3'UTR choice [29, 40, 59] is prone tounique gene regulatory paradigms. A clearer understanding will require systematic depletion of themachinery within a single experimental system [13], and to understand the native 3’-end profiledifferences between systems.Coupling Between Transcriptional and 3'-end Processing MachineriesFunctional coupling between transcription and 3'-end processing extends beyond the role of thetranscriptional elongation rate in cleavage site choice. RNA polymerase II is an essential mRNApolyadenylation factor in its own right, both in vivo and in vitro [60, 61]. The RNA polymerase IIcarboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) interacts with many of the 3'-end processing factors [62-65].Interaction with the CTD is thought to recruit the 3'-end processing sub-complexes to the pre-mRNA, positioning them for cleavage and polyadenylation, with RNA polymerase II acting as aplatform for 3'-end processing. Furthermore, various transcription factors have also been shown toplay a role in cleavage site selection. PAF1C is a transcriptional elongation factor that has been9associated with enhanced 3'-end processing [66]. Depletion of the PAF1C subunits Cdc73, Paf1 orSki8 resulted in a global increase in proximal site usage in murine myocytes [67]. Paf1 ablation wasalso linked to the accumulation of RNA polymerase II along gene bodies suggesting that this is dueto a reduced transcriptional elongation rate [67]. Similarly, decreased expression of the murinetranscription elongation factor Ell2 also caused enhanced proximal site usage and a concomitantswitch from membrane-tethered immunoglobulins to their secreted form [68]. In this case, Ell2increased CstF-64 association with RNA polymerase II and thus caused a high local concentrationof CstF-64 at more proximal cleavage sites.Coupling Between Splicing and 3'-end Processing MachineriesA link between alternative polyadenylation and splicing is becoming increasingly clear (Figure 1c-e). For example, the U1 snRNP affects cleavage and polyadenylation independently of its role insplicing. Knockdown of U1 snRNP promotes the use of cryptic polyadenylation sites within intronsclose to the 5'-end of the transcript [69]. It was suggested that binding of U1 snRNP to theseregions blocks their recognition. Surprisingly, more moderate decreases in U1 snRNP levels eliciteda shift to more proximal 3'UTR cleavage sites rather than the use of upstream intronic cleavagesites indicating that the impact of U1 snRNP is dose-dependent [70]. Furthermore, U2 snRNPmediates CPSF loading to the pre-mRNA and the U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF) interacts withCFIm-59, both of which stimulate cleavage and polyadenylation [71, 72]. A confounding factor tothe interpretation of links between splicing and polyadenylation is the degree of cross-talk betweenthe two systems [73]. Movassat et al. [74], suggest for example, that extensive terminal exonsplicing induced by CstF-64 knockdown can be explained by changes to 3'UTR choice in coresplicing factors, the altered expression of which then indirectly alter transcriptome-wide splicingchoices.10Regulation of Alternative Polyadenylation by PAS OcclusionPolyadenylation sites can be blocked by protein and/or RNA elements that compete with thebinding of 3'-end processing factors. Multiple proteins have been identified that interfere with CstF-64 binding and cause a shift in polyadenylation site choice [73, 75, 76]. For example, the poly(A)binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) plays an important role in 3'end processing [77]. In addition toits function in poly(A)-length control, PABPN1 has been shown to associate with weaker proximalAPA sites suppressing their cleavage [59]. As a result, PABPN1 knockdown facilitates a shift toproximal site usage. Depletion of the major cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein, PABPC1, appearsto cause 3’UTR shortening to a similar extent as PABPN1 indicating that this may be a generalfunction of PABPs [13]. Conversely, some RNA binding proteins aid the 3'-end processingmachinery in site recognition, promoting the use of weaker cis elements. The human TREX subunitThoc5 co-transcriptionally loads CFIm-68 onto target genes [78]. Therefore, like CFIm-68depletion, a decrease in Thoc5 results in a shift towards proximal site usage [78]. Furthermore, thecytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 1 (CPEB1) can shuttle to the nucleus and bindto cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPE) within the pre-mRNA sequence [79]. This aids inthe recruitment of CPSF to weaker DSEs and therefore proximal cleavage site use is increased.Importantly, occluded cleavage sites can be responsive to, and revealed by, cellular signalling.Danckwardt et al. [80], identified the RNA binding proteins FBP2 and FBP3, at upstream elementswithin the F2 (thrombin) 3’UTR. External stresses such as inflammatory cytokines that activate p38MAPK, result in phosphorylation of the FBP RNA binding proteins, causing their dissociation fromtarget mRNA, and activation of 3’-end processing [80].An emerging theme in modulators of APA is to control their own cleavage and polyadenylation inan auto-regulatory fashion. For example, the Drosophila embryonic lethal abnormal visual systemprotein (ELAV) and its homologue in mammals, HuR, directly bind to proximal cleavage sites11suppressing 3'end processing through steric hindrance [81, 82]. Both ELAV and HuR auto-regulatetheir abundance through binding to proximal polyadenylation sites within their own pre-mRNAscausing longer 3'UTR isoforms [83, 84]. The cleavage and polyadenylation machinery itself alsoappears to be self-equilibrating. The CstF-77 primary transcript for example, harbours a cryptictruncating adenylation site that buffers expression of the full-length, functional protein [85]. Thusan excess of cleavage and polyadenylation activity feeds back to limit its own expression.Pre-mRNA secondary structures have also been shown to impact site selection [86, 87]. IEAAT2possesses a stem-loop structure within its 7th intron. Adenosine/Inosine RNA editing results inincreased use of a cryptic alternative polyadenylation site within the stem-loop region [88]. Finally,non-coding RNAs may also play a role in polyadenylation site switching. The long non-codingRNA colon cancer-associated transcript 2 (CCAT2), has been implicated in cleavage site selectionfor the gene glutaminase (GLS) [89]. CCAT2 interacts with the CFIm complex, causing CFIm-25recruitment, which, in this case, promotes cleavage at a cryptic PAS within intron 14 of GLS. Thisresults in the synthesis of the short GAC protein isoform that triggers glutamine metabolism and isimplicated in metastasis.Rather than any of these models acting alone, it is likely that alternative polyadenylation siteselection is under the combinatorial control of various mechanisms and that site choice can beregulated in a multitude of ways including those yet to be identified.Dysregulation of Alternative Polyadenylation in DiseaseAs the majority of human genes undergo alternative 3'-end processing at some time duringdevelopment [7], it is not surprising that APA dysregulation has been associated with multipledisease states (See Table 2). In general, genome-wide research in disease tissue and in models of12disease have suggested a trend toward global shortening of 3'UTRs. Although this trend is beingchallenged [90]. Furthermore, it is important to note that comparison of the specific transcriptssubject to change in 3'-end usage in these studies shows surprisingly little overlap. Of the 3137different transcripts identified subject to APA across 4 different studies [51, 90-92] compared here,only 10 are shared, and of these only 7 change in the same direction, toward shortening (Figure 3a).Since the discovery that proliferating and cancer cells have a tendency to express shorter 3'UTRs[93, 94], the role of APA in cancer has become the most well-studied of any disease state [1, 58,95]. In a comprehensive recent review, Gruber et al. [96] provide evidence that the expression levelof 3'-end processing factors is highly correlated to the proliferative index of human cells. Given thathigh levels of such factors tend to alter APA site selection, it is not surprising that APA in cancerhas been a major topic of current research.Perhaps the most comprehensive study of APA in cancer to date was performed by Xia et al. [51],who inferred APA events from the RNA-Seq read coverage of tumour/normal pairs in the cancergenome atlas (TCGA). Their bioinformatic analysis identified 1,346 dynamic APA events across 7tumour types. In general, 3'UTR shortening was found to be associated with tumourigenesis andCstF-64 was suggested to be a master regulator of APA in tumours. The authors also found APA tobe more predictive of tumour outcome than gene expression. The possibility of the prognostic valueof APA events was independently shown also in prostate cancer by Li et al. [95], albeit, theseauthors also note a significant sub-population of transcripts that switch to longer 3'UTR isoforms.The heterogeneity of APA events is underpinned by comparison of the overlap of APA events indifferent cancer types from the study by Xia et al. [51] (Figure 3b). Of the 920 transcripts subject toAPA, only 22 are shared between the five cancers shown. Of these 22, 18 are shortened in allcancer types.13Cancer can be a heterogeneous disease. In breast cancer, for example, multiple subtypes are known,with varying properties determined from both clinical markers [97] and associated gene expressionsignatures [98]. It remains to be seen whether APA could provide additional prognostic value overcurrent clinical parameters in breast cancer. To date, the research has been mixed. By contrastingtwo different breast cancer cell lines to a cultured mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A, Fu et al.[92], showed a polar opposite trend in 3'UTR choices. The luminal derived MCF7 cell lineexhibited the expected 3'UTR shortening. In contrast, the MDA-MB-231 cells showed lengtheningrelative to the epithelial control. Such data highlight the complexity of the underlying biology ineach individual tumour type and suggest that definitive global statements are no longer useful asdescriptors in disease. Instead, new research should focus on identification of the specific APAevents that are prognostic for disease outcome.Importantly, as with alternative splicing, alternative 3'-end processing can have major regulatoryeffects with very little change in overall mRNA expression level [99]. The addition/removal, ofstability, translation and localisation elements in just a few key regulatory genes could send geneexpression programs down divergent developmental trajectories. If this were not alreadycomplicated enough, new research shows that 3'UTRs can act as protein complex assemblyscaffolds [100, 101]. In this case, a change in 3'-end usage can impact the co-translationalassembly of cellular machines. It is therefore important not to be drawn into generalisations.Although some 3'UTR shortening events clearly result in increases in protein expression (See Table2), multiple studies now show that shortened 3'UTRs do not necessarily result in more proteinsynthesis [90]. Moreover, some research suggests that distal isoforms can be more efficientlytranslated [19, 102, 103]. Indeed there may be as many activating elements in 3'UTRs as there arerepressive elements [104].14While the number of protein-coding genes are maintained, APA events appear to scale withcomplexity, [Reviewed: [100]], so it follows that APA is likely a means of increasing functionaland regulatory diversity. The dysregulation of these processes is therefore likely common to allcomplex diseases. Systematic identification of the highly diversified and specific disease-associatedAPA events provides a massive challenge. However, if the early suggestions of the prognosticpower of specific APA events in cancer prove correct, there is also a considerable opportunity. Thismight be particularly the case when APA events are considered in combination with other modes ofgene expression control such as alternative splicing and post transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.Finally, in analogy to the breakthroughs in exon-skipping for muscular dystrophy, perhaps futuretherapeutics that selectively switch 3'UTR choice, will provide an opportunity to produce amongthe most targeted, medicines ever created.AcknowledgementsWe thank members of the Beilharz Lab for constructive comment on the manuscript.

Mechanisms of Alternative PolyadenylationPolyadenylation events can be split into five different categories, four of which involve alternativepolyadenylation. A) Constitutive polyadenylation involves the occurrence of a single potentialpoly(A) site within the 3' UTR of the transcript. B) Tandem 3’UTR APA genes possess two or morecleavage poly(A) sites within their 3’UTR. Resulting transcripts only differ by the length of theiruntranslated region. C) Alternative terminal exon APA requires alternative splicing to occur thatchanges the last exon and therefore the available poly(A) site. D) Intronic APA involves the use ofcryptic alternative poly(A) sites found within introns. E) Internal exon APA uses poly(A) siteswithin upstream exons and results in a transcript lacking a stop codon or a 3’UTR.22Figure 2. Core Cis Elements Involved in Cleavage and Polyadenylation Site RecognitionThe cleavage and polyadenylation machinery is guided to target RNA by a series of cis elements asindicated. These are generalised here in schematic form, but it is important to note that few givengenes will encode all elements. The positioning elements in simple eukaryotes such as S. cerevisiaetend to be more divergent than their mammalian counterparts.23Figure 3. APA is disease and condition specificGenome-wide APA genes are more likely to be unique than shared among disease states. A) Venn-diagram of overlapping gene sets from 4 different experimental datasets. The APA eventsdetermined by comparing test versus control samples from the failing human heart [91], 7 cancertypes [51],2 breast cancer cell lines (HER2 positive and negative) [92] and activated mouse T cells [90]. Only10 genes were shared in APA genes in all experiments and these are listed to the right of thediagram. B) Venn-diagram of overlapping APA events from 5 of the 7 tumour types inferred fromRNA-seq coverage [51]. The percentage of APA genes unique to each condition are indicated.2425Table 1.
